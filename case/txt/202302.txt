Part III    
Reading Comprehension          
(40 minutes) 
 
Section A 
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each 
blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully 
before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding 
letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the 
words in the bank more than once. 
Imagine sitting down to a big dinner: a massive steak, a large portion of fried potatoes, and cake for 
dessert. After eating so much, you should be too full to eat another bite. But some people experience a 
powerful urge to keep eating, even after ___26___ in a huge meal, a behavior that makes little sense, as 
most adults are well-versed in the dangers of obesity, which researchers have shown correlates with 
___27___ health issues and is even linked to increased ___28___ risk. But some people still keep eating 
long after they should stop, a phenomenon Dr. Susan Thompson calls " insatiable ( 永不满足的) 
hunger." It is characterized by two main ___29___: not being satisfied by eating, and having a desire to 
stay sedentary (久坐不动的). 
This is at ___30___ with how humans are biologically programmed. When there was a great deal 
of food available, ancient people would gorge on calories; this massive calorie intake was accompanied 
by an urge to get active. Humans were also programmed for something called "compensation," which is 
the brain's ___31___ mechanism for preventing the accumulation of excess weight. With compensation, 
if you eat one large meal in the morning, you are naturally ___32___ to eat less for the rest of the day. 
But recent studies show that 70% of American adults have lost the ability to naturally compensate 
for the calories they consume; worse ___33___, a significant number of them report ___34___ hunger 
halfway through an eating session, but, by the end of the meal, they feel the same or higher levels of 
hunger than when they sat down. Dr. Thompson argues that the main cause of this phenomenon is the 
modern diet, which is ___35___ of food high in sugar, carbohydrates and calories.

Section B 
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each 
statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the 
information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a 
letter. Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2. 
The problem with being perfect 
A) When psychologist Jessica Pryor lived near an internationally renowned university, she once saw a 
student walking into a library holding a sleeping bag and a coffee maker. She has heard of graduate 
students spending 12 to 18 hours at a time in the lab. Their schedules are meant to be literally punishing: 
If they are scientists-in-training, they won't allow themselves to watch Netflix until their experiments 
start generating results. "Relationships become estranged (疏远的)-people stop inviting them to social 
gatherings or dinner parties, which leads them to spend even more time in the lab," Pryor told me. 
B) Along with other therapists, Pryor, who is now with the Family Institute at Northwestern University, is 
trying to sound the alarm about a tendency among young adults and college students to strive for 
perfection in their work—sometimes at any cost. Though it is often portrayed as a positive trait, Pryor 
and others say extreme perfectionism can lead to depression, anxiety, and even suicide. 
C) What's more, perfectionism seems to be on the rise. In a study of thousands of American, Canadian, and 
British college students published earlier this year, Thomas Curran of the University of Bath and Andrew 
Hill of York St. John University found that today's college students report higher levels of perfectionism 
than college students did during the 1990s or early 2000s. They measured three types of perfectionism: 
self-oriented, or a desire to be perfect; socially prescribed, or a desire to live up to others' expectations; 
and other-oriented, or holding others to unrealistic standards. From 1989 to 2016, they found, 
self-oriented perfectionism scores increased by 10 percent, socially prescribed scores rose by 33 percent, 
and other-oriented perfectionism increased by 16 percent. 
D) A person living with an other-oriented perfectionist might feel criticized by the perfectionist spouse for 
not doing household chores exactly the "right" way. "One of the most common things couples argue 
about is the proper way of loading the dishwasher," says Amy Bach, a psychologist in Providence, Rhode 
Island. 
E) Curran describes socially prescribed perfectionism as "My self-esteem is contingent on what other people 
think." His study didn't examine the causal reasons for its rise, but he assumes that the rise of both 
standardized testing and social media might play a role. These days, LinkedIn alerts us when our rival 
gets a new job, and Instagram can let us know how well "liked" our lives are compared with a friend's. In 
an opinion piece earlier this year, Curran and Hill argue that society has also become more dog-eat-dog. 
"Over the last 50 years, public interest and civic responsibility have been progressively eroded," they 
write, "replaced by a focus on self-interest and competition in a supposedly free and open marketplace." 
We strive for perfection, it seems, because we feel we must in order to get ahead. Michael Brustein, a 
clinical psychologist in Manhattan, says when he first began practicing in 2007, he was surprised by how 
prevalent perfectionism was among his clients, despite how little his graduate training had focused on the 
 2023 年6 月英语六级真题第2 套  第5 页，共8 页
phenomenon. He sees perfectionism in, among others, clients who are entrepreneurs, artists, and tech 
employees. "You're in New York because you're ambitious, you have this need to strive," he says. "But 
then your whole identity gets wrapped into a goal." 
F) Perfectionism can, of course, be a positive force. Think of professional athletes, who train aggressively for 
ever-higher levels of competition. In well-adjusted perfectionism, someone who doesn't get the gold is 
able to forget the setback and move on. In maladaptive (不当的) perfectionism, meanwhile, people make 
an archive of all their failures. They revisit these archives constantly, thinking, as Pryor puts it, "I need to 
make myself feel terrible so I don't do this again." Then they double down, "raising the expectation bar 
even higher, which increases the likelihood of defeat, which makes you self-critical, so you raise the bar 
higher, work even harder," she says. Next comes failure, shame, and pushing yourself even harder toward 
even higher and more impossible goals. Meeting them becomes an "all or nothing" premise. Pryor 
offered this example: "Even if I'm an incredible attorney, if I don't make partner in the same pacing as 
one of my colleagues, clearly that means I'm a failure." 
G) Brustein says his perfectionist clients tend to devalue their accomplishments, so that every time a goal is 
achieved, the high lasts only a short time, like "a gas tank with a hole in it." If the boss says you did a 
great job, it's because he doesn't know anything. If the audience likes your work, that's because it's too 
stupid to know what good art actually is. But, therapists say, there are also different ways perfectionism 
manifests. Some perfectionists are always pushing themselves forward. But others actually fall behind on 
work, unable to complete assignments unless they are, well, perfect. Or they might handicap their 
performance ahead of time. They're the ones partying until 2 a. m. the night before the final, so that when 
the grade C rolls in, there's a ready excuse. 
H) While educators and parents have successfully convinced students of the need to be high performing and 
diligent, the experts told me, they haven't adequately prepared them for the inevitability of failure. 
Instead of praises like "You're so smart," parents and educators should say things like "You really stuck 
with it," Pryor says, to emphasize the value of perseverance over intrinsic talent. Pryor notes that many of 
her clients are wary she'll "turn them into some degenerate couch potato and teach them to be okay with 
it." Instead, she tries to help them think through the parts of their perfectionism they'd like to keep, and to 
lose the parts that are ruining their lives. 
I) Bach, who sees many students from Brown University, says some of them don't even go out on weekends, 
let alone weekdays. She tells them, "Aim high, but get comfortable with good enough." When they don't 
get some award, she encourages them to remember that "one outcome is not a basis for a broad 
conclusion about the person's intelligence, qualifications, or potential for the future." 
J) The treatment for perfectionism might be as simple as having patients keep logs of things they can be 
proud of, or having them behave imperfectly in small ways, just to see how it feels. "We might have 
them hang the towels crooked ( 不正的) or wear some clothing inside out," says Martin Antony, a 
professor in the department of psychology at Ryerson University in Toronto. 
K) Brustein likes to get his perfectionist clients to create values that are important to them, then try to shift 
their focus to living according to those values rather than achieving specific goals. It's a play on the "You 
really stuck with it" message for kids. In other words, it isn't about doing a headstand in yoga class; it's 
about going to yoga class in the first place, because you like to be the kind of person who takes care of 
herself. But he warns that some people go into therapy expecting too much-an instant transformation of 
themselves from a pathological (病态的) perfectionist to a (still high-achieving) non-perfectionist. They 
try to be perfect, in other words, at no longer being perfect. 
36. Socially prescribed perfectionism is described as one's self-esteem depending on other people's opinion. 
37. Jessica Pryor has learned that some graduate students work such long hours in the lab that they have little 
time for entertainment or socializing. 
38. The author believes perfectionism may sometimes be constructive.

Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished 
statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best 
choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
How on earth did we come to this? We protect our children obsessively from every harm; we 
scrutinize every carer, teacher or doctor with whom they come into contact. Yet despite all this, one 
group, which in no way has their best interests at heart, has almost unconstrained access. 
We seem to take it for granted that advertisers and marketers are allowed to condition even the 
youngest children. Before children have even developed a proper sense of their own identity, or learned 
to handle money, they're encouraged to associate status and self-worth with stuff, and to look to external 
things such as fame and wealth for validation. We're turning out little consumers rather than young 
citizens who will value themselves for what they contribute to the society in which they live. 
We've reached this point so gradually that many of us have never questioned it. It's crept up on us 
in the 60years since advertisers started to target the young and found that they could recruit them to a 
commercial assault on their parents. We've come to know it as "pester power" or the ability of children 
to pressure parents to make certain purchases. 
Many psychologists, child development experts and educators point to research suggesting that this 
emerging cradle-to-grave consumerism is contributing to growing rates of low self-esteem, depression 
and other forms of mental illness. 
Not all psychologists agree. There're plenty working hand in glove with a ￡12bn-a-year industry 
that has turned the manipulation of adult emotions and desires into an art form-often literally. It's also 
one that's forever developing new ways to persuade our children to desire material possessions, and 
because of advertisements' viral effect they only need to infect a few to reach the many. Advertising and 
marketing can serve a useful purpose for children. Marketing may help socialize children as consumers, 
inform them about products, and help them carve out unique identities as they reach adulthood. 
Then, should we ban all advertising aimed at young children? I say yes. 
Of course there'll be plenty of objections to an outright ban on advertising to the under-11s. There'll 
be those who argue that would be a breach of freedom of speech and infringe the rights of corporations 
to brainwash little children into demanding their products. 
Most parents hate what advertising does to their children, but we do have the power to end it and 
let our children grow up free from many of the pressures of consumerism until they're old enough to 
make their own decisions. And though advertising is only part of an all-pervasive ( 无处不在的) 
marketing culture we need to make a start somewhere. Let's ban all advertising targeting children of 
primary school age and younger now. 
46. Which group of people does the author say has almost unrestricted access to children? 
A) Advertisers.          
B) Carers.          
C) Teachers.          
D) Doctors.

B) Those who value themselves because of their contribution to society.

D) Those who have developed a proper sense of their own identity. 
48. Many child development experts and educators call attention to research that suggests______.  
A) life-long consumerism is causing more and more cases of psychological problems. 
B) increasing commercialization of education is eroding many children's self-esteem. 
C) the growing desire for wealth is contributing to a rising rate of depression. 
D) the craving for purchasing material things is nurtured throughout one's life. 
49. What does the author imply about the impact of advertising? 
A) It is actually infectious to many rather than a few. 
B) It is rooted in our desire for material possessions. 
C) It is comparable to that of virus. 
D) It is literally limited to children. 
50. What is the opponents' argument against a complete ban on advertising to young children? 
A) It would deprive them of the chance to learn about products. 
B) It would render them unable to carve out unique identities. 
C) It would breach their freedom as would-be consumers. 
D) It would violate the rights endowed upon advertisers. 
  
Passage Two 
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage. 
Many oppose workplace surveillance, because of the inherent dehumanizing effect it has and the 
relentless pressure it brings. But it's on the rise around the world as firms look to become more efficient by 
squeezing more productivity from their workers. More than half of companies with over $750m in annual 
revenue used "non-traditional” monitoring techniques on staff last year. 
Monitoring employee performance gives firms the ability to assess how their staff are performing and 
interacting, which can be good for both the firm and employees themselves. A growing number of analytics 
companies offer this service. They gather "data exhaust" left by employees' email and instant messaging 
apps, and use name badges equipped with radio-frequency identification devices and microphones. These 
can check how much time you spend talking, your volume and tone of voice, even if you do not dominate 
conversations. While this may sound intrusive, exponents argue that it can also protect employees against 
bullying and sexual harassment. 
Some of this data analysis can produce unexpected results. For example, it was found that people who 
sat at 12-person lunch tables tended to interact, share ideas more and outperform those who regularly sat at 
four-person tables, a fact that would probably have gone undetected without such data analysis. 
Over the last few years a Stockholm co-working space called Epicenter has gone much further and 
holds popular "chipping parties", where people can have microchips implanted in their hands. They can use 
the implants to access electronically-controlled doors, or monitor how typing speed correlates with heart rate. 
Implanted chips may seem extreme, but it is a relatively small step from ID cards and biometrics to such 
devices. 
As long as such schemes are voluntary, there will probably be a growing number of 
convenience-oriented uses so that a substantial number of workers would opt to have a chip inserted. But if 
implanted chips are used to reduce slack time or rest breaks, that could prove to be detrimental. And if 
surveillance tools take away autonomy, that's when they prove most unpopular. A lot depends on how such 
monitoring initiatives are communicated and this could prevent possible revolts being staged. 
 2023 年6 月英语六级真题第2 套  第8 页，共8 页
If bosses don't communicate effectively, employees assume the worst. But if they're open about the 
information they're collecting and what they're doing with it, research suggests 46% of employees are 
generally okay with it. Although many such monitoring schemes use anonymised data and participation is 
voluntary, many staffers remain sceptical and fear an erosion of their civil liberties. 
So workplace surveillance could be empowering for staff and useful for companies looking to become 
more efficient and profitable. But implemented in the wrong way, it could also become an unpopular tool of 
oppression that proves counterproductive. 
51. Why are many people opposed to monitoring employee performance? 
A) It puts workers under constant pressure. 
B) It is universally deemed anti-human by nature. 
C) It does both mental and physical harm to employees monitored. 
D) It enables firms to squeeze maximal productivity from employees. 
52. What is the supporters' argument for workplace surveillance? 
A) It enables employees to refrain from dominating conversations. 
B) It enhances employees' identification with firms they work in. 
C) It can alert employees to intrusion into their privacy. 
D) It can protect employees against aggressive behavior. 
53. What does the author want to show by the example of different numbers of people interacting at lunch 
tables? 
A) Data analysis is key to the successful implementation of workplace surveillance. 
B) Analyzing data gathered from workers can yield something unexpected. 
C) More workmates sitting at a lunch table tend to facilitate interaction and idea sharing. 
D) It is hard to decide on how many people to sit at a lunch table without data analysis. 
54. What does much of the positive effect of monitoring initiatives depend on? 
A) How frequently employees are to be monitored. 
B) What specific personal information is being excluded. 
C) What steps are taken to minimize their detrimental impact. 
D) How well bosses make known their purpose of monitoring. 
55. What concern do monitoring initiatives cause among many staffers? 
A) They may empower employers excessively. 
B) They may erode the workplace environment. 
C) They may infringe upon staffers' entitled freedom. 
D) They may become counterproductive in the long run.
