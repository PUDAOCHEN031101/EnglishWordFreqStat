But many economists say it will take more than low interest rates to persuade consumers to take on more debt. There are already signs that the recent stock market fluctuations, turbulence in Europe and the US deficit have scared consumers. On Friday, preliminary data showed that the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index had fallen this month to lower than it was in November 2008, when the United States was deep in recession.  Under normal circumstances, the Fed's announcement might have attracted new home and car buyers and prompted credit card holders to rack up fresh charges. But with unemployment high and those with jobs worried about keeping them, consumers are more concerned about paying off the loans they already have than adding more debt. And by showing its hand for the next two years, the Fed may have thoughtlessly invited prospective borrowers to put off large purchases.  Lenders, meanwhile, are still dealing with the effects of the boom-gone-bust and are forcing prospective borrowers to go to extraordinary lengths to prove their creditworthiness.  "I don't think lenders are going to be interested in extending a lot of debt in this environment," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm. "Nor do I think households are going to be interested in taking on a lot of debt."  In housing, consumers have already shown a slow response to low rates. Applications for new mortgages have decreased this year to a 10-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Sales of furniture and furnishings remain 22% below their pre-recession peak, according to Spending Pulse, a research report by MasterCard Advisors.  Credit card rates have actually gone up slightly in the past year. The one bright spot in lending is the number of auto loans, which is up from last year. But some economists say that confidence among car buyers is hitting new lows.  For Xavier Walter, a former mortgage banker who with his wife, Danielle, accumulated$20 000 in credit card debt, low rates will not change his spending habits.  As the housing market topped out five years ago, he lost his six-figure income. He and his wife were able to modify the mortgage on their four-bedroom house in Medford, New Jersey, as well as negotiate lower credit card payments.  Two years ago, Mr. Walter, a 34-year-old father of three, started an energy business. He has sworn off credit. "I'm not going to go back in debt ever again," he said. "If I can't pay for it in cash, I don't want it."  Until now, one of the biggest restraints on consumer spending has been a debt aftereffect. Since August 2008, when household debt peaked at$12.41 trillion, it has declined by about$1.2 trillion, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics of data from the Federal Reserve and Equifax, the credit agency. A large portion of that, though, was simply written off by lenders as borrowers defaulted on loans.  By other measures, households have improved their position. The proportion of after-tax income that households spend to remain current on loan payments has fallen.  Still, household debt remains high. That presents a paradox: many economists argue that the economy cannot achieve true health until debt levels decline. But credit, made attractive by low rates, is a time-tested way to increase consumer spending.  With new risks of another downturn, economists worry that it will take years for debt to return to manageable levels. If the economy contracts again, said George Magnus, senior adviser at UBS, then "you could find a lot of households in a debt trap which they probably can never get out of."  Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, burned by the housing crash, are extra careful about approving new loans. In June, for instance, Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage buyer in the United States, said that borrowers whose existing debt exceeded 45 to 50% of their income would be required to have stronger "compensating" factors, which might include higher savings.  Even those borrowers in strong financial positions are asked to provide unusual amounts of paperwork. Bobby and Katie Smith have an extremely good credit record, tiny student debt and a combined six-figure income. For part of their down payment, they planned to use about$5 000 they had received as wedding gifts in February.  But the lender would not accept that money unless the Smiths provided a certified letter from each of 14 guests, stating that the money was a gift, rather than a loan.  "We laughed for a good 15 or 20 minutes." recalled Mr. Smith. 34.  Mr. Smith, a program director for a radio station in Orlando, Florida, said they ended up using other savings for their down payment to buy a$300 000 four-bedroom house in April.  For those not as creditworthy as the Smiths, low rates are irrelevant because they no longer qualify for mortgages. That leaves the eligible pool of loan applicants wealthier, "older and whiter," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. "It's creating much more of a divide," he said, "between the haves and the have-nots."  Car shoppers with the highest credit ratings can also get loans more easily, and at lower rates, said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association  During the recession, inability to obtain credit severely cut auto buying as lenders rejected even those with good credit ratings. Now automakers are increasing their subprime（次级债的）lending again as well, but remain hesitant to approve large numbers of risky customers.  The number of new auto loans was up by l6% in the second quarter compared with the previous year, said Melinda Zabritski, director of automotive credit at Experian, the information services company.  But some economists warn that consumer confidence is falling. According to CNW Marketing Research, confidence among those who intend to buy a car this year is at its lowest since it began collecting data on this measure in 2000.  On credit cards, rates have actually inched higher this year. largely because of new rules that curb the issuer's ability to charge fees or raise certain interest rates at will.  At the end of the second quarter, rates averaged 14. 01% on new card offers, up from 13. 75% a year earlier, according to Mail Monitor, which tracks credit cards for Synovate, a market research firm. According to data from the Federal Reserve, total outstanding debt on revolving credit cards was down by 4. 6% during the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier.  Even if the Fed's announcement helps keep rates steady. or pushes them down, businesses do not expect customers to suddenly charge up a storm.  "It's not like, 'Oh, credit is so cheap. let's go back to the heydays（鼎盛时期）,",said Elizabeth Crowell, who owns Sterling Place, two high-end home furnishing and gift stores in New York. "People still fear for their jobs. So I think where maybe after other recessions they might return to previous spending habits, the pendulum hasn't swung back the same way."  注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。  1 .What is the purpose of the announcement issued by the US Federal Reserve last week?

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.   Questions 47 to 54 are based on the following passage. For many families, figuring out how many after-school activities are too many is a struggle. For parents who fear they're "over-scheduling" their children, a new study carries a comforting message. The paper, published last week by the Society for Research in Child Development, is the first to take a data-driven look at the issue-and whether being so busy is really a bad thing. The study suggests the phenomenon is more isolated than media reports suggest: in fact. 40,七 of children(ages 5-18) are engaged in no activities, typical kids spend just five hours a week in structured activities, and very few children-3-6%-spend 20 hours a week. On average, most kids spend far more time watching TV and playing games. And for kids who're extremely busy, there's also good news: the more activities they do, the better kids perform on measures of educational achievement and psychological adjustment. "This popular concern [about over-scheduling] has been generated by a couple of parenting books and the media," says Yale professor and lead author Joseph Mahoney. But looking at the data, "it's hard to argue that kids are over-scheduled."  That news will be welcome in households like the Oviedos', in Highland Park, Ill. Nine-year-old Bianca spends six hours a week in rhythmic-gymnastics classes and three hours a week at ballet, plus a half-hour piano lesson. "The alternative would be playing on the computer or watching TV," says her mother, Anca, who believes Bianca benefits by learning to focus, making new friends and acquiring new skills.  The new paper doesn't sway some experts who've advocated against activity-creep. They say kids arc far busier-and overstressed by it all-than the numbers suggest. "This is an example of researchers using big data sets to dispute the lived experience of many, many parents and families," says William Doherty, a University of Minnesota family- studies professor. Some skeptics question whether the self-reported time-diary data are really accurate; others say they don't account for all the time spent getting between activities. Alvin Rosenfeld. co-author of The Over-Scheduled Child, says: "If people follow this advice and do more activities, I think it'll be pretty damaging." Despite the doubters, the new data are a small step toward a better understanding of what's best for kids. And no matter what the numbers show, there's no disputing that every child is different--and some will absolutely do better with less. Lisa DuIg of South Lyon, Mich., feels as though her 6-year-old twins are the only kids in town who don't take skiing and ice-skating lessons. "There is nothing wrong with cuddling up（依偎）on the couch with Mom and Dad," says Lisa. And for families who prefer to bond on the sidelines of soccer fields, the latest research can provide a different kind of comfort.  注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。  47 The question in dispute in the passage is whether or not children are_____?  48 It can be inferred that a good way to keep children away from TV and video games is to engage them in______.  49 According to the new study, children will _____academically and psychologically if they involve themselves in more after-school activities.  50. There are skeptics who raise doubts about the new study. saying that its data may be____.  51 .In spite of the controversy, the new study may help people see more clearly____.   Section B Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A）, B）, C） and D）. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.   Who's poor in America? That's a question hard to answer. Hard because there's no conclusive definition of poverty. Low income matters, though how low is unclear. Poverty is also a state of mind that fosters self-defeating behavior-bad work habits, family breakdowns, and addictions. Finally, poverty results from bad luck: accidents, job losses, disability.  Despite poverty's messiness, we've measured progress against it by a single statistic: the federal poverty line. By this measure, we haven't made much progress. But the apparent lack of progress is misleading for two reasons.  First, it ignores immigration. Many immigrants are poor and low-skilled. They add to the poor. From 1989 to 2007, about three quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics（西班牙裔美国人）-mostly immigrants and their children.  Second, the poor's material well-being has improved. The official poverty measure obscures this by counting only pre-tax cash income and ignoring other sources of support, including food stamps and housing subsidies. Although many poor live from hand to mouth, they've participated in rising living standards. In 2005, 91% had microwaves. 79% air-conditioning, and 48% cell phones.  The existing poverty line could be improved by adding some income sources and subtracting some expenses. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal for a "supplemental poverty measure" in 2011 goes beyond that. The new poverty number would compound public confusion. It also raises questions about whether the statistic is tailored to favor a political agenda. The "supplemental measure" ties the poverty threshold to what the poorest third of Americans spend on food, housing, clothing, and utilities. The actual threshold will probably be higher than today's poverty line. Many Americans would find this weird: people get richer, but "poverty" stays stuck..  What produces this outcome is a different view of poverty. The present concept is an absolute one: the poverty threshold reflects the amount estimated to meet basic needs. By contrast, the new measure embraces a relative notion of poverty: people are automatically poor if they're a given distance from the top, even if their incomes are increasing.  The new indicator is a "propaganda device" to promote income redistribution by showing that poverty is stubborn or increasing. The Census Bureau has estimated statistics similar to the administration's proposal. In 2008, the traditional poverty rate was 13.2%; estimates of the new statistic range up to l7%. The new poverty statistic exceeds the old, and the gap grows larger over time.  As senator Daniel Moynihan said, the administration is defining poverty up. It's legitimate to debate how much we should aid the poor or reduce economic inequality. But the debate should not be swayed by misleading statistics that few Americans could possibly understand. Government statistics should strive for political neutrality（中立）.This one fails.  注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。  52. What is the main idea of the first paragraph?

What does the author think of the administration's proposal for a "supplemental poverty measure"?  A) It is intended to further help the poor. C) It is a positive response to changed circumstances.  B) It is made to serve political purposes. D) It is an attempt to combat the economic recession.  55. What is characteristic of the new measure of poverty?  A) It defines poverty by the gap between the rich and the poor.  B) It raises the threshold for the poor to get welfare benefits.  C) It is more accurate and scientific in terms of statistics.  D) It truly reflects the practical needs of the poor.  56. What does the author want to say by quoting Daniel Moynihan?  A) Economic equality is but an empty dream.  B) Political neutrality can never be achieved.  C) The administration's statistics are biased.  D) The debate over poverty will get nowhere.     Passage Two Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. Eleven summers ago I was sent to a management program at the Wharton School to be prepared for bigger things. Along with lectures on finance and entrepreneurship and the like, the program included a delightfully out-of-place session with Al Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on poetry.  For three hours he talked us through "The Red Wheelbarrow" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The experience----especially when contrasted with the horrible prose of our other assigned reading--sent me fleeing to the campus bookstore, where I resumed a long-interrupted romance with meter and rhyme（韵）.  Professor Filreis says that he is "a little shocked" at how intensely his Wharton students respond to this unexpected deviation from the businesslike, not just as a relief but as a kind of stimulus. Many write afterward asking him to recommend books of poetry. Especially now,  "The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think 'out of the box' in the way poetry encourages," he told me.  Which brings me to Congress, an institution stuck deeper inside the box than just about any other these days. You have probably heard that up on Capitol Hill（美国国会山）,they're very big on prayer breakfasts, where members gather over scrambled eggs and ask God for wisdom. You can judge from the agonizing debt spectacle we've watched this summer how well that's working. Well, maybe it's time to add some poetry readings to the agenda.  I'm not suggesting that poetry will guide our legislators to wisdom any more than prayer has. Just that it might make them a little more human. Poetry is no substitute for courage or competence, but properly applied, it is a challenge to self-certainty, which we currently have in excess. Poetry serves as a spur to creative thinking, a reproach to dogma and habit, a remedy to the current fashion for pledge signing.  The poet Shelley, in defense of poetry nearly two centuries ago, wrote, "A man. to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own."Shelley concludes that essay by calling poets "the unacknowledged legislators of the world, "because they bring imagination to the realm of "reasoners and mechanists."  The relevance of poetry was declared more concisely in five lines from the love poem "Asphodel. That Greeny Flower," by William Carlos Williams:  It is difficult to get the news form poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there  注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。  57. Why did the author participate in the Wharton School management program?  A) He was a passionate lover of classical poetry.  B) He was being trained for an important position.  C) He had just been promoted to top management.  D) He was interested in finance and entrepreneurship.  58. What did the author think of Professor Filreis's poetry session?  A) It diverted students' attention from the assigned reading  B) It made the management program appear romantic.  C) It was extremely appealing to the students.  D )It pulled students out of prose reading sessions.  59. What was the impact of the poetry session on the program participants according to Professor Filreis?  A) It inspired them to view things from broader perspectives.  B) It led them to think poetry indispensable to management.  C) It helped them develop a keener interest in literature.  D) It encouraged them to embark on a political career.  60. What does the author think of Capitol Hill's prayer over breakfast?  A) It is a ritual that has lost its original meaning.  B) It doesn't really help solve the economic problems.  C) It provides inspiration as poetry reading does.  D) It helps people turn away from the debt spectacle.  61. What do we learn from Shelley's essay?  A) Poetry can relieve people of pains and sufferings.  B) It takes poetic imagination to become a legislator.  C) Legislators should win public acknowledgement.  D) It is important to be imaginative and sympathetic.
