Scientists recently examined studies on dog intelligence and compared them with research into the 
minds of other intelligent animals. The researchers found that dogs are among the more intelligent 
carnivores ( 食肉动物), social hunters and domestic animals, but that their intelligence does not 
___26___ other intelligent animals in any of those categories. Though a significant body of research has 
examined dog cognition ___27___, the authors of this new study found little to warrant the ___28___ of 
work that has been devoted to the topic. 
Stephen Lea, lead author of the new study, argues that many researchers seem to have designed 
their studies to ___29___ how clever dogs are, rather than simply to study dogs' brains. Lea and a 
colleague examined more than 300 studies of dog cognition, comparing the studies' results with those 
from research into other animals. The researchers made specific comparisons between the different 
species in different categories of intelligence. These comparisons ___30___ that dogs are intelligent, but 
their intelligence is not as ___31___ as some researchers might have believed. 
In many areas, though, comparisons were not possible. For example, the researchers noted that 
both dogs and cats are known to be able to recognize and ___32___ human voices. But the investigators 
could not find any data to indicate which species can remember a greater number of ___33___ human 
voices, so it was impossible to compare the two on that front. However, not all researchers agree 
___34___ with the findings of this study. Zachary Silver, an American researcher, believes the authors 
of the new study ___35___ the idea that an excessive amount of research has been devoted to dogs, as 
the field of dog cognition is young, and there is much to be learned about how dogs think.

information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a 
letter. Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2. 
The lifesaving power of gratitude 
A) Gratitude may be more beneficial than we commonly suppose. One recent study asked participants to 
write a note of thanks to someone and then estimate how surprised and happy the recipient would 
feel—an impact that they consistently underestimated. Another study assessed the health benefits of 
writing thank-you notes. The researchers found that writing as few as three weekly thank-you notes over 
the course of three weeks improved life satisfaction, increased happy feelings and reduced symptoms of 
depression. 
B) While this research into gratitude is relatively new, the principles involved are anything but. Students of 
mine in a political philosophy course at Indiana University are reading Daniel Defoe's 300-year-old 
Robinson Crusoe, often regarded as the first novel published in English. Left alone on an unknown island 
with no apparent prospect of rescue or escape, Crusoe has much to lament (悲). But instead of giving in 
to despair, he makes a list of things for which he is grateful, including the fact that he is the sole survivor 
from the shipwreck (海难) and has been able to salvage many useful items from the wreckage. 
C) Defoe's masterpiece, which is often ranked as one of the world's greatest novels, provides a portrait of 
gratitude in action that is as timely and relevant today as it has ever been. It is also one with which 
contemporary psychology and medicine are just beginning to catch up. Simply put, for most of us, it is 
far more helpful to focus on the things in life for which we can express gratitude than those that incline 
us toward resentment and lamentation. 
D) When we focus on the things we regret, such as failed relationships, family disputes, and setbacks in 
career and finance, we tend to become more regretful. Conversely, when we focus on the things we are 
grateful for, a greater sense of happiness tends to spread through our lives. And while no one would 
argue for cultivating a false sense of blessedness, there is mounting evidence that counting our blessings 
is one of the best habits we can develop to promote mental and physical health. 
E) Gratitude has long enjoyed a privileged position in many of the world's cultural traditions. For example, 
some ancient Western philosophers counsel gratitude that is both enduring and complete, and some 
Eastern thinkers portray it as not merely an attitude but a virtue to be put into practice. 
F) Recent scientific studies support these ancient teachings. Individuals who regularly engage in gratitude 
exercises, such as counting their blessings or expressing gratitude to others, exhibit increased satisfaction 
with relationships and fewer symptoms of physical illness. And the benefits are not only psychological 
and physical. They may also be moral—those who practice gratitude also view their lives less 
materialistically and suffer from less envy. 
 2023 年6 月英语六级真题第1 套  第5 页，共8 页
G) There are multiple explanations for such benefits of gratefulness. One is the fact that expressing gratitude 
encourages others to continue being generous, thus promoting a virtuous cycle of goodness in 
relationships. Similarly, grateful people may be more likely to reciprocate (回报) with acts of kindness of 
their own. Broadly speaking, a community in which people feel grateful to one another is likely to be a 
more pleasant place to live than one characterized by mutual suspicion and resentment. The beneficial 
effects of gratitude may extend even further. For example, when many people feel good about what 
someone else has done for them, they experience a sense of being lifted up, with a corresponding 
enhancement of their regard for humanity. Some are inspired to attempt to become better people 
themselves, doing more to help bring out the best in others and bringing more goodness into the world 
around them. 
H) Gratitude also tends to strengthen a sense of connection with others. When people want to do good things 
that inspire gratitude, the level of dedication in relationships tends to grow and relationships seem to last 
longer. And when people feel more connected, they are more likely to choose to spend their time with 
one another and demonstrate their feelings of affection in daily acts. 
I) Of course, acts of kindness can also foster discomfort. For example, if people feel they are not worthy of 
kindness or suspect that some ulterior (别有用心的) motive lies behind it, the benefits of gratitude will 
not be realized. Likewise, receiving a kindness can give rise to a sense of indebtedness, leaving 
beneficiaries feeling that they must now pay back whatever good they have received. Gratitude can 
flourish only if people are secure enough in themselves and sufficiently trusting to allow it to do so. 
Another obstacle to gratitude is often called a sense of entitlement. Instead of experiencing a benefaction 
(善行) as a good turn, people sometimes regard it as a mere payment of what they are owed, for which 
no one deserves any moral credit. 
J) There are a number of practical steps anyone can take to promote a sense of gratitude. One is simply 
spending time on a regular basis thinking about someone who has made a difference, or perhaps writing a 
thank-you note or expressing such gratitude in person. Others are found in ancient religious disciplines, 
such as reflecting on benefactions received from another person or actually praying for the health and 
happiness of a benefactor. In addition to benefactions received, it is also possible to focus on 
opportunities to do good oneself, whether those acted on in the past or hoped for in the future. Some 
people are most grateful not for what others have done for them but for chances they enjoyed to help 
others. In regularly reflecting on the things in his life he is grateful for, Defoe's Crusoe believes that he 
becomes a far better person than he would have been had he remained in the society from which he 
originally set out on his voyage. 
K) Reflecting on generosity and gratitude, the great basketball coach John Wooden once offered two 
counsels to his players and students. First, he said, "It is impossible to have a perfect day unless you have 
done something for someone who will never be able to repay you." In saying this, Wooden sought to 
promote purely generous acts, as opposed to those performed with an expectation of reward. Second, he 
said, "Give thanks for your blessings every day.” 
L) Some faith traditions incorporate such practices into the rhythm of daily life. For example, adherents of 
some religions offer prayers of thanksgiving every morning before rising and every night before lying 
down to sleep. Others offer thanks throughout the day, such as before meals. Other less frequent special 
events, such as births, deaths and marriages, may also be heralded by such prayers. 
M) When Defoe depicted Robinson Crusoe making thanksgiving a daily part of his island life, he was 
anticipating findings in social science and medicine that would not appear for hundreds of years. Yet he 
was also reflecting the wisdom of religious and philosophical traditions that extend back thousands of 
years. Gratitude is one of the healthiest and most nourishing of all states of mind, and those who adopt it 
as a habit are enriching not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them.

Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished 
statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best 
choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
Technology is never a neutral tool for achieving human ends. Technological innovations reshape 
people as they use these innovations to control their environment. Artificial intelligence, for example, is 
altering humanity. 
While the term AI conjures up anxieties about killer robots or catastrophic levels of 
unemployment, there are other, deeper implications. As AI increasingly shapes the human experience, 
how does this change what it means to be human? Central to the problem is a person's capacity to make 
choices, particularly judgments that have moral implications. 
Aristotle argued that the capacity for making practical judgments depends on regularly making 
them—on habit and practice. We see the emergence of machines as substitute judges in a variety of 
everyday contexts as a potential threat to people learning how to effectively exercise judgment 
themselves. 
In the workplace, managers routinely make decisions about who to hire or fire and which loan to 
approve, to name a few. These are areas where algorithmic (算法的) prescription is replacing human 
judgment, and so people who might have had the chance to develop practical judgment in these areas no 
longer will. 
Recommendation engines, which are increasingly prevalent intermediaries in people's consumption 
of culture, may serve to constrain choice and minimize luck. By presenting consumers with 
algorithmically selected choices of what to watch, read, stream and visit next, companies are replacing 
human taste with machine taste. In one sense, this is helpful. After all, machines can survey a wider 
range of choices than any individual is likely to have the time or energy to do on their own. 
At the same time, though, this selection is optimizing for what people are likely to prefer based on 
what they've preferred in the past. We think there is some risk that people's options will be constrained 
by their past in a new and unanticipated way. 
As machine learning algorithms improve and as they train on more extensive data sets, larger parts 
of everyday life are likely to become utterly predictable. The predictions are going to get better and 
better, and they will ultimately make common experiences more efficient and pleasant. 
Algorithms could soon-if they don't already—have a better idea about which show you'd like to 
 2023 年6 月英语六级真题第1 套  第7 页，共8 页
watch next and which job candidate you should hire than you do. One day, humans may even find a way 
for machines to make these decisions without some of the biases that humans typically display. 
But to the extent that unpredictability is part of how people understand themselves and part of what 
people like about themselves, humanity is in the process of losing something significant. As they 
become more and more predictable, the creatures inhabiting the increasingly AI-mediated world will 
become less and less like us. 
46. What do we learn about the deeper implications of AI? 
A) It is causing catastrophic levels of unemployment. 
B) It is doing physical harm to human operators. 
C) It is altering moral judgments. 
D) It is reshaping humanity. 
47. What is the consequence of algorithmic prescription replacing human judgment? 
A) People lose the chance to cultivate the ability to make practical judgments. 
B) People are prevented from participating in making major decisions in the workplace. 
C) Managers no longer have the chance to decide which loan to approve. 
D) Managers do not need to take the trouble to determine who to hire or fire. 
48. What may result from increasing application of recommendation engines in our consumption of 
culture? 
A) Consumers will have much limited choice.  C) It will be easier to decide on what to enjoy. 
B) Consumers will actually enjoy better luck. 
D) Humans will develop tastes similar to machines'. 
49. What is likely to happen to larger parts of our daily life as machine learning algorithms improve? 
A) They will turn out to be more pleasant.  
C) They can be completely anticipated. 
B) They will repeat our past experience. 
D) They may become better and better. 
50. Why does the author say the creatures living in the more and more Al-mediated world will become 
increasingly unlike us? 
A) They will have lost the most significant human element of being intelligent. 
B) They will no longer possess the human characteristic of being unpredictable. 
C) They will not be able to understand themselves as we can do today. 
D) They will be deprived of what their predecessors were proud of about themselves. 
  
Passage Two 
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage. 
Phonics, which involves sounding out words syllable （音节) by syllable, is the best way to teach 
children to read. But in many classrooms, this can be a dirty word. So much so that some teachers have had 
to sneak phonics teaching materials into the classroom. Most American children are taught to read in a way 
that study after study has found to be wrong. 
The consequences of this are striking. Less than half of all American adults were proficient readers in 
2017. American fourth graders rank 15th on the Progress in International Literacy Study, an international 
exam. 
America is stuck in a debate about teaching children to read that has been going on for decades. Some 
advocate teaching symbol-sound relationships (the sound k can be spelled as c, k, ck, or ch), known as 
phonics. Others support an immersive approach (using pictures of a cat to learn the word cat), known as 
"whole language". Most teachers today, almost three out of four according to a survey by the Ed Week 
Research Centre in 2019, use a mix called "balanced literacy". This combination of methods is ineffective. 
"You can't sprinkle in a little phonics," says Tenette Smith, executive director of elementary education and 
reading at Mississippi's education department. "It has to be systematic and explicitly taught." 
Mississippi, often behind in social policy, has set an example here. In a state once notorious for its low 
 2023 年6 月英语六级真题第1 套  第8 页，共8 页
reading scores, the Mississippi state legislature passed new literacy standards in 2013. Since then Mississippi 
has seen remarkable gains. Its fourth graders have moved from 49th (out of 50 states) to 29th on the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress, a nationwide exam. In 2019 it was the only state to improve its scores. 
For the first time since measurement began, Mississippi's pupils are now average readers, a remarkable 
achievement in such a poor state. 
Mississippi's success is attributed to implementing reading methods supported by a body of research 
known as the science of reading. In 1997 Congress requested the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development and the Department of Education to convene a National Reading Panel to end the 
"reading wars" and synthesize the evidence. The panel found that phonics, along with explicit instruction in 
phonemic (音位的)awareness, fluency and comprehension, worked best. 
Yet over two decades on, "balanced literacy" is still being taught in classrooms. But advances in 
statistics and brain imaging have disproved the whole-language method. To the teacher who is a proficient 
reader, literacy seems like a natural process that requires educated guessing, rather than the deliberate 
process emphasized by phonics. Teachers can imagine that they learned to read through osmosis (潜移默化) 
when they were children. Without proper training, they bring this to classrooms. 
51. What do we learn about phonics in many American classrooms? 
A) It is ill reputed. 
C) It is arbitrarily excluded. 
B) It is mostly misapplied. 
D) It is misrepresented. 
52. What has America been witnessing for decades? 
A) An obsession with innovating teaching methodologies of reading. 
B) An enduring debate over the approach to teaching children to read. 
C) An increasing concern with many children's inadequacy in literacy. 
D) An ever-forceful advocacy of a combined method for teaching reading. 
53. Why does Tenette Smith think a combination of teaching methods is ineffective? 
A) Elementary school children will be frustrated when taught with several methods combined. 
B) Phonics has to be systematically applied and clearly taught to achieve the desired effect. 
C) Sprinkling in a little phonics deters the progress of even adequately motivated children. 
D) Balanced literacy fails to sustain children's interest in developing a good reading habit. 
54. What does the author say Mississippi's success is attributed to? 
A) Convening a National Reading Panel to synthesize research evidence. 
B) Placing sufficient emphasis upon both fluency and comprehension. 
C) Adopting scientifically grounded approaches to teaching reading. 
D) Obtaining support from Congress to upgrade teaching methods. 
55. What have advances in statistics and brain imaging proved ineffective? 
A) The teaching of symbol-sound relationships. 
C) Efforts to end the reading wars. 
B) Explicit instruction in phonemic awareness. 
D) The immersive approach.
