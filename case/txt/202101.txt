example, by

Asian culture with chopsticks and traditional dress. Characters that did represent a 
minority culture usually had

roles in the books. The main characters were mostly Caucasian. This 
causes concern as it can lead to an impression that whiteness is of greater value. 
Dr. Adam said children formed impressions about 'difference' and identity from a very young age.

How Marconi Gave Us the Wireless World 
A) A hundred years before iconic figures like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs permeated our lives, an Irish­
Italian inventor laid the foundation of the communication explosion of the 21st century. Guglielmo
Marconi was arguably the first truly global figure in modern communication. Not only was he the first
to communicate globally, he was the first to think globally about communication. Marconi may not
have been the greatest inventor of his time, but more than anyone else, he brought about a
fundamental shift in the way we communicate.
B) Today's globally networked media and conimunication system has its origins in the 19th century, when,
for the first time, messages were sent electronically across great distances. The telegraph, the
-telephone, and radio were the obvious predecessors of the-Internet, -iPotls, and-mobile phones. What
made the link from then to now was the development of wireless communication. Marconi was the first
to develop and perfect this system, using the recently-discovered "air waves" that make up the
electromagnetic spectrum.
C) Between 1896, when he applied for his first patent in England at the age of 22, and his death in Italy
in 1937, Marconi was at the center of every major innovation in electronic communication. He was
also a skilled and sophisticated organizer, an entrepreneurial innovator, who mastered the use of
corporate strategy, media relations, government lobbying, international diplomacy, patents, and
prosecution. Marconi was really interested in only one thing: the extension of mobile, personal, long­
distance communication to the ends of the earth ( 
and beyond, if we can believe some reports) . Some
like to refer to him as a genius, but if there was any genius to Marconi it was this vision.
D) In 1901 he succeeded in signaling across the Atlantic, from the west coast of England to Newfoundland
in the USA, despite the claims of science that it could not be done. In 1924 he convinced the British
government to encircle the world with a chain of wireless stations using the latest technology that he
had devised, shortwave radio. There are some who say Marconi lost his edge when commercial
broadcasting came along; he didn't see that radio could or should be used to frivolous (::JGJMJ(ID) ends.
In one of his last public speeches, a radio broadcast to the United States in March 1937, he deplored
that broadcasting had become a one-way means of communication and foresaw it moving in another
'* 
2021  6 J=1 
4 
公众号：多学英语
 direction, toward communication as a means of exchange. That was visionary genius. 
E) Marconi's career was devoted to making wireless communication happen cheaply, efficiently,
smoothly, and with an elegance that would appear to be intuitive and uncomplicated to the user-user­
friendly, if you will. There is a direct connection from Marconi to today's social media, search
engines, and program streaming that can best be summed up by an admittedly provocative
exclamation: the 20th century did not exist. In a sense, Marconi's vision jumped from his time to our
own.
F) Marconi invented the idea of global communication-or, more straightforwardly, globally networked,
mobile, wireless communication. Initially, this was wireless Morse code telegraphy ( It fiBm. i-tU , the
principal communication technology of his day. Marconi was the first to develop a practical method for
wireless telegraphy using radio waves. He borrowed technical details from many sources, but what set
him apart was a self-confident vision of the power of communication technology on the one hand, and,
on the other, of the steps that needed to be taken to consolidate his own position as a player in that
field. Tracing Marconi's lifeline leads us into the story of modern communication itself. There were
other important figures, but Marconi towered over them all in reach, power, and influence, as well as
in the grip he had on the popular imagination of his time. Marconi was quite simply the central figure
in the emergence of a modern understanding of communication.
G) In his lifetime, Marconi foresaw the development of television and the fax machine, GPS, radar, and
the portable hand-held telephone. Two months before he died, newspapers were reporting that he was
working on a "death ray," and that he had "killed a rat with an intricate device at a distance of three
feet." By then, anything Marconi said or did was newsworthy. Stock prices rose or sank according to
his pronouncements. If Marconi said he thought it might rain, there was likely to be a run on
umbrellas.
H) Marconi's biography is also a story about choices and the motivations behind them. At one level,
Marconi could be fiercely autonomous and independent of the constraints of his own social class. On
another scale, he was a perpetual outsider. Wherever he went, he was never "of" the group; he. was
always the "other," considered foreign in Britain, British in Italy, and "not American" in the United
States. At the same time, he also suffered tremendously from a need for acceptance that drove, and
sometimes stained, every one of his relationships.
I) Marconi placed a permanent stamp on the way we live. He was the first person to imagine a practical
application for the wireless spectrum, and to develop it successfully into a global communication
system-in both terms of the word; that is, worldwide and all-inclusive. He was able to do this because
of a combination of factors-most important, timing and opportunity-but the single-mindedness and
determination with which he carried out his self-imposed mission was fundamentally character-based;
millions of Marconi's contemporaries had the same class, gender, race, and colonial privilege as he,
but only a handful did anything with it. Marconi needed to achieve the goal that was set in his mind as
an adolescent; by the time he reached adulthood, he understood, intuitively, that in order to have an
impact he had to both develop an independent economic base and align himself with political power.
Disciplined, uncritical loyalty to political power became his compass. for the choices he had to make.
J) At the same time, Marconi was uncompromisingly independent intellectually. Shortly after Marconi's
death, the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi-soon to be the developer of the Manhattan Project-wrote
that Marconi proved that theory and experimentation were complementary features of progress.
"Experience can rarely, unless guided by a theoretical concept, arrive at results of any great
significance 
... 
on the other hand, an excessive ·trust in theoretical conviction would have prevented
Marconi from persisting in experiments which were destined t0 bring about a revolution in the
technique of radio-communications." In other words, Marconi had the advantage of not being
burdened by preconceived assumptions.

 K) The most controversial aspect of Marconi's life-and the reason why there has been no satisfying
biography of Marconi until now-was his uncritical embrace of Benito Mussolini. At first this was not
problematic for him. But as the regressive ( fftliJH1g) nature of Mussolini's ·regime became clear, he
began to suffer a crisis of conscience. However, after a lifetime of moving within the circles of power,
he was unable to break with authority, and served Mussolini faithfully ( as president of Italy's national
research council and royal academy, as well as a member of the Fascist Grand Council) until the day
he died-conveniently-in 1937, shortly before he would have had to take a stand in the conflict that
consumed a world that he had, in part, created.
36. Marconi was central to our present-day understanding of communication.
37. As an adult, Marconi had an intuition that he had to be loyal to politicians in order to be influential.
38. Marconi disapproved of the use of wireless communication for commercial broadcasting.
39. Marconi's example demonstrates that theoretical concepts and experiments complement each other in
making progress in science and technology.
40. Marconi's real interest lay in the development of worldwide wireless communication:
41. Marconi spent his whole life making wireless communication simple to use.
42. Because of his long-time connection with people in power, Marconi was unable to cut himself off from
the fascist regime in Italy.
43. In his later years, Marconi exerted a tremendous influence on all aspects of people's life.
44. What connected the 19th century and our present time was the development of wireless
communication.
45. Despite his autonomy, Marconi felt alienated and suffered from a lack of acceptance.
Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished 
statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the
best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
Humans are fascinated by the source of their failings and virtues. This preoccupation inevitably leads 
to an old debate: whether nature or nurture moulds us more. A revolution in genetics has poised this as a 
modern political question about the character of our society: 
personalities are hard-wired into our genes' 
what can governments do to help us? It feels morally questionable, yet claims of genetic selection by 
intelligence are making headlines. 
This is down to" 
hereditarian" CilHitag) science and a recent paper claimed "differences in exam 
performance between pupils attending selective and non-selective schools mirror the genetic differences 
between them". With such an assertion, the work was predictably greeted by a lot of absurd claims about 
"genetics determining academic success". What the research revealed was the rather less surprising result: 
the educational benefits of selective schools largely disappear once pupils' inborn ability and socio­
economic background were taken into account. It is a glimpse of the blindingly obvious-and there's 
nothing to back strongly either a hereditary or environmental argument. 
Yet the paper does say children are "unintentionally genetically selected" by the school system. 
Central to hereditarian science is a tall claim: that identifiable variations in genetic sequences can predict 
an individual's aptness to learn, reason and solve problems. This is problematic on many levels. A teacher 
could not seriously tell a parent their child has a low genetic tendency to study when external factors 
clearly exist. Unlike-minded academics say the inheritability of human traits is scientifically unsound. At 
best there is a weak statistical association and not a causal link between DNA and intelligence. Yet 
sophisticated statistics are used to create an intimidatory atmosphere of scientific certainty. 
While there's an undoubted genetic basis to individual difference, it is wrong to think that socially 
* 
2021 
6 J=i 
6 
公众号：多学英语
 defined groups can be genetically accounted for. The fixation on genes as destiny is surely false too. 
Medical predictability can rarely be based on DNA alone; the environment matters too. Something as 
complex as intellect is likely to be affected by many factors beyond genes. If hereditarians want to advance 
their cause it will require more balanced interpretation and not just acts. of advocacy. 
Genetic selection is a way of exerting influence over others, "the ultimate collective control of human 
destinies," as writer H. G. Wells put it. Knowledge becomes power and power requires a sense of 
responsibility. In understanding cognitive ability, we must not elevate discrimination to a science; allowing 
people to climb the ladder of life only as far as their cells might suggest. This will need a more sceptical 
eye on the science. As technology progresses, we all have a duty to make sure that we shape a future that 
we would want to find ourselves in. 
46. What did a recent research paper claim?
A) The type of school students attend makes a difference to their future.
B) Genetic differences between students are far greater than supposed.
C) The advantages of selective schools are too obvious to ignore.
D) Students' academic performance is determined by their genes.

7. What does the author think of the recent research? 
A) Its result was questionable.
C) Its influence was rather negligible.
B) Its implication was positive.
D) Its conclusions were enlightening.
48. What does the author say about the relationship between DNA and intelligence?
A) It is one of scientific certainty.
C) It is subject to interpretation of statistics.
B) It is not one of cause and effect.
D) It is not fully examined by gene scientists.
49. What do hereditarians need to do to make their claims convincing?
A) Take all relevant factors into account in interpreting their data.
B) Conduct their research using more sophisticated technology.
C) Gather gene data from people of all social classes.
D) Cooperate with social scientists in their research.
50. What does the author warn against in the passage?
A) Exaggerating the power of technology in shaping the world.
B) Losing sight of professional ethics in conducting research.
C) Misunderstanding the findings of human cognition research.
D) Promoting discrimination in the name of science.
Passage Two 
Questions 51 to SS are based on the following passage. 
Nicola Sturgeon's speech last Tuesday setting out the Scottish government's legislative programme for 
the year ahead confirmed what was already pretty clear. Scottish councils are set to be the first in the UK 
with the power to levy charges on visitors, with Edinburgh likely to lead the way. 
Tourist taxes are not new. The Himayalan kingdom of Bhutan has a longstanding policy of charging 
visitors a daily fee. France's tax on overnight stays was introduced to assist thermal spa (t'lffi.jjl) towns to 
develop, and around half of French local authorities use it today. 
But such levies are on the rise. Moves by Barcelona and Venice to deal with the phenomenon of 
"over-tourism" through the use of charges have recently gained prominence. Japan and Greece are among 
the countries to have recently introduced tourist taxes. 
That the UK lags behind gs due to our weak, by international standards, local government, as well as 
the opposition to taxes and regulation of our aggressively pro-market ruling party. Some UK cities have 
lobbied without success for the power to levy a charge on visitors. Such levies are no universal remedy as 
the amounts raised would be tiny compared with what has been taken away by central government since 
2010. Still, it is to be hoped that the Scottish government's bold move will prompt others to act. There is 
* 
2021

公众号：多学英语
 no reason why visitors to the UK, or domestic tourists on holiday in hotspots such as Cornwall, should be 
exempt from taxation-particularly when vital local services including waste collection, park maintenance 
and arts and culture spending are under unprecedented strain. 
On the contrary, compelling tourists to make a financial contribution to the places they visit beyond 
their personal consumption should be part of a wider cultural shift. Westerners with disposable incomes 
have often behaved as if they have a right to go wherever they choose with little regard for the 
consequences. Just as the environmental harm caused by aviation and other transport must come under far 
greater scrutiny, the social cost of tourism must also be confronted. This includes the impact of short-term 
lets on housing costs and quality of life for residents. Several European capitals, including Paris and 
Berlin, are leading a campaign for tougher regulation by the European Union. It also includes the impact 
of overcrowding, litter and the kinds of behaviour associated with noisy parties. 
There is no "one size fits all" solution to this problem. The existence of new revenue streams for some 
but not all councils is complicated, and businesses are often opposed, fearing higher costs will make them 
uncompetitive. But those places that want them must be given the chance to make tourist taxes work. 
51. What do we learn from Nicola Sturgeon's speech?
A) The UK is set to adjust its policy on taxation.
B) Tourists will have to pay a tax to visit Scotland.
C) The UK will take new measures to boost tourism.
D) Edinburgh contributes most to Scotland's tourism.
52. How come the UK has been slow in imposing the tourist tax?
A) Its government wants to attract more tourists.
B) The tax is unlikely to add much to its revenue.
C) Its ruling party is opposed to taxes and regulation.
D) It takes time for local governments to reach consensus.
53. Both international and domestic visitors in the UK should pay tourist tax so as to ___ 
_
A) elevate its tourism to international standards
B) improve the welfare of its maintenance workers
C) promote its cultural exchange with other nations
D) ease its financial burden of providing local services
54, What does the author sa-y about Western tourists? 
A) They don't seem to care about the social cost of tourism.
B) They don't seem to mind paying for additional services.
C) They deem travel an important part of their life.
D) They subject the effects of tourism to scrutiny.
55. What are UK people's opinions about the levy of tourist tax?
A) Supportive.
B) Skeptical.
C) Divided.
