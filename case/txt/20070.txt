In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent “Plans for  survey. Their career path may be financially rewarding, but it doesn’t meet their emotional, social or creative needs. They’re stuck, unhappy, and have no idea what to do about it, except move to another job. Mary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life and Career Clinic, says that when most people are unhappy about their work, their first thought is to get a different job. Instead, Miller suggests looking at the possibility of a different life. Through her book, 8 Myths of Making a Living, as well as workshops, seminars and personal coaching and consulting, she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work. Like the way of Zen, which includes understanding of oneself as one really is, Miller encourages job seekers and those dissatisfied with work or life to examine their beliefs about work and recognize that “in many cases your beliefs are what brought you to where you are today.” You may have been raised to think that women were best at nurturing and caring and, therefore, should be teachers and nurses. So that’s what you did. Or, perhaps you were brought up to believe that you should do what your father did, so you have taken over the family business, or become a dentist “just like dad.” If this sounds familiar, it’s probably time to look at the new possibilities for your future. Miller developed a 7-step process to help potential job seekers assess their current situation and beliefs, identify their real passion, and start on a journey that allows them to pursue their passion through work. Step 1: Willingness to do something different. Breaking the cycle of doing what you have always done is one of the most difficult tasks for job seekers. Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path or make a change, even if it doesn’t feel right. Miller ges job seekers to open their minds to other possibilities beyond what they are currently doing. Step 2: Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be. Look at the gifts and talents you have and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most. If you love the social aspects of your job, but are stuck inside an office or “chained to your desk” most of the time, vow to follow your instinct and investigate alternative careers and work that allow you more time to interact with others. Dawn worked as a manager for a large retail clothing store for several years. Though she had advanced within the company, she felt frustrated and longed to be involved with nature and the outdoors. She decided to go to school nights and weekends to pursue her true passion by earning her master’s degree in forestry. She now works in the biotech forestry division of a major paper company. Step 3: Self-definition. Miller suggests that once job seekers know who they are, they need to know how to sell themselves. “In the job market, you are a product. And just like a product, you must know the features and benefits that you have to offer a potential client, or employer.” Examine the skills and knowledge that you have and identify how they can apply to your desired occupation. Your qualities will exhibit to employers why they should hire you over other candidates. Step 4: Attain a level of self-honoring. Self-honoring or self-love may seem like an odd step for job hunters, but being able to accept yourself, without judgment, helps eliminate insecurities and will make you more self-assured. By accepting who you are – all your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being – you’ll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers. The power of self-honoring can help to k all the falsehoods you were programmed to believe – those that made you feel that you were not good enough, or strong enough, or intelligent enough to do what you truly desire. Step 5: ion. Miller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to “What do I really want to do?” one should create a solid statement in a dozen or so sentences that describe in detail how they see their life related to work. For instance, the secretary who longs to be an actress describes a life that allows her to express her love of Shakespeare on stage. A real estate agent, attracted to his current job because he loves fixing up old homes, describes buying properties that need a little tender loving care to make them more saleable. Step 6: Appropriate risk. Some philosophers believe that the way to enlightenment comes through facing obstacles and difficulties. Once people discover their passion, many are too scared to do anything about it. Instead, they do nothing. With this step, job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit of their dream. For one working mom, that meant taking night classes to learn new computer-aided design skills, while still earning a salary and keeping her day job. For someone else, it may mean quitting his or her job, taking out a loan and going back to school full time. You’ll move one step closer to your ideal work life if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are willing to make. Step 7: Action. Some teachers of philosophy describe action in this way, “If one wants to get to the top of a mountain, just sitting at the foot thinking about it will not bring one there. It is by making the effort of climbing up the mountain, step by step, that eventually the summit is reached.” All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideals. Creating a plan and taking it one step at a time can lead to new and different job opportunities. Job-hunting tasks gain added meaning as you sense their importance in your quest for a more meaningful work life. The plan can include researching ustries and occupations, talking to people who are in your desired area of work, taking classes, or accepting volunteer work in your targeted field. Each of these steps will lead you on a journey to a happier and more rewarding work life. After all, it is the journey, not the destination, that is most important. 注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。 1.

Part IV Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes） Section A  Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2. Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage. Google is a world-famous company, with its headquarters in . It was set up in a  garage in 1998, and inflated (膨胀) with the Internet bubble. Even when everything around it collapsed the company kept on inflating. Google’s search engine is so widespread across the world that search became Google, and google became a verb. The world fell in love with the effective, fascinatingly fast technology. Google owes much of its success to the brilliance of  and L. Page, but also to a series of fortunate events. It was Page who, at Stanford in 1996, initiated the academic project that eventually became Google’s search engine. Brin, who had met Page at a student orientation a year earlier, joined the project early on. They were both Ph.D. candidates when they devised the search engine which was better than the rest and, without any marketing, spread by word of mouth from early adopters to, eventually, your grandmother. Their kthrough, simply put, was that when their search engine crawled the Web, it did more than just look for word matches; it also tallied (统计) and ranked a host of other critical factors like how websites link to one another. That ivered far better results than anything else. Brin and Page meant to name their creation Googol (the mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes), but someone misspelled the word so it stuck as Google. They raised money from prescient (有先见之明的) professors and venture capitalists, and moved off campus to turn Google into a business. Perhaps their biggest stroke of luck came early on when they tried to sell their technology to other search engines, but no one met their price, and they built it up on their own. The next kthrough came in 2000, when Google figured out how to make money with its invention. It had lots of users, but almost no one was paying. The solution turned out to be advertising, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that Google is now tially an advertising company, given that that’s the source of nearly all its revenue. Today it is a giant advertising company, worth $100 billion. 注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。 47.	Apart from a series of fortunate events, what is it that has made Google so successful? 48.	Google’s search engine originated from ________ started by L. Page. 49.	How did Google’s search engine spread all over the world? 50.	Brin and Page decided to set up their own business because no one would ________. 51.	The revenue of the Google company is largely generated from ________. Section B Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage. You hear the refrain all the time: the  economy looks good statistically, but it doesn’t feel good. Why doesn’t ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97. The Affluent Society is a modern classic because it helped define a new moment in the human condition. For most of history, “hunger, sickness, and cold” threatened nearly everyone, Galbraith wrote. “Poverty was found everywhere in that world. Obviously it is not of ours.” After World War II, the dread of another Great Depression gave way to an economic boom. In the 1930s unemployment had averaged 18.2 percent; in the 1950s it was 4.5 percent. To Galbraith, materialism had gone mad and would breed discontent. Through advertising, companies conditioned consumers to buy things they didn’t really want or need. Because so much spending was artificial, it would be unfulfilling. Meanwhile, government spending that would make everyone better off was being cut down because people instinctively—and wrongly—led government only as “a necessary evil.” It’s often said that only the rich are getting ahead; everyone else is standing still or falling behind. Well, there are many undeserving rich—overpaid chief executives, for instance. But over any meaningful period, most people’s incomes are increasing. From 1995 to 2004, inflation-adjusted average family income rose 14.3 percent, to $43,200. People feel “squeezed” because their rising incomes often don’t satisfy their rising wants—for bigger homes, more health care, more education, faster Internet connections. The other great frustration is that it has not eliminated insecurity. People regard job stability as part of their standard of living. As corporate layoffs increased, that part has eroded. More workers fear they’ve become “the disposable American,” as Louis Uchitelle puts it in his book by the same name. Because so much previous suffering and social conflict stemmed from poverty, the arrival of widespread affluence suggested utopian (乌托邦式的) possibilities. Up to a point, affluence succeeds. There is much less physical misery than before. People are better off. Unfortunately, affluence also creates new complaints and contradictions. Advanced societies need economic growth to satisfy the multiplying wants of their citizens. But the quest for growth lets loose new anxieties and economic conflicts that disturb the social order. Affluence liberates the ividual, promising that everyone can choose a unique way to self-fulfillment. But the promise is so extravagant that it predestines many disappointments and sometimes inspires choices that have anti-social consequences, including family kdown and obesity (肥胖症). Statistical indicators of happiness have not risen with incomes. Should we be surprised? Not really. We’ve simply reaffirmed an old truth: the pursuit of affluence does not always end with happiness. 52.	What question does John Kenneth Galbraith raise in his book The Affluent Society? A) Why statistics don’t tell the truth about the economy. B) Why affluence doesn’t guarantee happiness. C) How happiness can be promoted today. D) What lies behind an economic boom.（B） 53.	According to Galbraith, people feel discontented because ________. A) public spending hasn’t been cut down as expected B) the government has proved to be a necessary evil C) they are in fear of another Great Depression D) materialism has run wild in modern society（D） 54.	Why do people feel squeezed when their average income rises considerably? A) Their material pursuits have gone far ahead of their earnings. B) Their purchasing power has dropped markedly with inflation. C) The distribution of wealth is uneven between the rich and the poor. D) Health care and educational costs have somehow gone out of control.（A） 55.	What does Louis Uchitelle mean by “the disposable n” (Line 3, . 5)? A) Those who see job stability as part of their living standard. B) People full of utopian ideas resulting from affluence. C) People who have little say in n politics. D) Workers who no longer have secure jobs.（D） 56.	What has affluence brought to n society? A) Renewed economic security. B) A sense of self-fulfillment. C) New conflicts and complaints. D) Misery and anti-social behavior.（C） Passage Two Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. The use of deferential (敬重的) language is symbolic of the Confucian ideal of the woman, which dominates conservative gender norms in Japan. This ideal presents a woman who withdraws quietly to the background, subordinating her life and needs to those of her family and its male head. She is a dutiful daughter, wife, and mother, master of the domestic arts. The typical refined ese woman excels in modesty and icacy; she “treads softly (谨言慎行)in the world,” elevating feminine beauty and grace to an art form. Nowadays, it is commonly observed that young women are not conforming to the feminine linguistic (语言的) ideal. They are using fewer of the very deferential “women’s” forms, and even using the few strong forms that are known as “men’s.” This, of course, attracts considerable attention and has led to an outcry in the ese media against the defeminization of women’s language. Indeed, we didn’t hear about “men’s language” until people began to respond to girls’ appropriation of forms normally reserved for boys and men. There is considerable sentiment about the “corruption” of women’s language—which of course is viewed as part of the loss of feminine ideals and morality—and this sentiment is crystallized by nationwide opinion polls that are regularly carried out by the media. Yoshiko Matsumoto has argued that young women probably er used as many of the highly deferential forms as older women. This highly polite style is no doubt something that young women have been expected to “grow into”—after all, it is a sign not simply of femininity, but of maturity and refinement, and its use could be taken to icate a change in the nature of one’s social relations as well. One might well imagine little girls using exceedingly polite forms when playing house or imitating older women—in a fashion analogous to little girls’ use of a high-pitched voice to do “teacher talk” or “mother talk” in role play. The fact that young Japanese women are using less deferential language is a sure sign of change—of social change and of linguistic change. But it is most certainly not a sign of the “masculinization” of girls. In some instances, it may be a sign that girls are making the same claim to authority as boys and men, but that is very different from saying that they are trying to be “masculine.” Katsue Reynolds has argued that girls nowadays are using more assertive language strategies in order to be able to compete with boys in schools and out. Social change also brings not simply different positions for women and girls, but different relations to life stages, and adolescent girls are participating in new subcultural forms. Thus what may, to an older speaker, seem like “masculine” speech may seem to an adolescent like “liberated” or “hip” speech. 57.	The first paragraph describes in detail ________. A) the standards set for contemporary ese women B) the Confucian influence on gender norms in  C) the stereotyped role of women in ese families D) the norms for traditional Japanese women to follow（B） 58.	What change has been observed in today’s young ese women? A) They pay less attention to their linguistic behavior. B) The use fewer of the deferential linguistic forms. C) They confuse male and female forms of language. D) They employ very strong linguistic expressions.（B） 59.	How do some people react to women’s appropriation of men’s language forms as reported in the ese media? A) They call for a campaign to stop the defeminization. B) They see it as an expression of women’s sentiment. C) They accept it as a modern trend. D) They express strong disapproval.（D） 60.	According to Yoshiko Matsumoto, the linguistic behavior observed in today’s young women ________. A) may lead to changes in social relations B) has been true of all past generations C) is viewed as a sign of their maturity D) is a result of rapid social progress（A） 61.	The author believes that the use of assertive language by young ese women is ________. A) a sure sign of their defeminization and maturation B) an ication of their defiance against social change C) one of their strategies to compete in a male-dominated society D) an inevitable trend of linguistic development in  today（C） Part V 								Cloze         				（15 minutes） Directions:	There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

First and foremost, there is a natural tendency to equate doing good deeds with a certain amount of reward, and reward with a certain amount of money. What is more, they maintain that since the basis of contemporary society is money, one of the major means of earning money is getting reward by doing good deeds. On the contrary, the vast majority of people assume that doing a good deed should be based on people’s personal consciousness. Hence, doing a good deed is fulfilling itself and reward is of minimal significance. Numerous examples can be given, but this will suffice. Mr. Leifeng lived a simple life dedicated to doing good deeds without expecting any reward and helping people from all walks of life, yet he was remembered as one of the most successful hero of our time. Generally speaking, it is my view that we should not expect a reward when doing a good deed. We do this for enjoyment, self-fulfillment and spiritual enhancement, not for the purpose of reward. 参考译文 很多人做好事期望得到回报。首先，人们常常自然而然地把做好事等同于一定的回报，又把回报等同于一定的金钱。其次，他们认为当今社会以金钱为基础，而挣钱的主要途径之一就是通过做好事获得回报。 反之，大多数人认为做好事应以个人觉悟为基础。因此，做好事本身就能满足个人需要，回报则可有可无。可以给出无数例子，这个就足够了。雷锋生活简朴，一生致力于做好事不计任何回报，同时帮助各行各业的人们，然而他被公认为我们时代最成功的楷模。 总之，我认为我们应该做好事不图回报。做好事本身就是一种享受、自我实现和精神升华，不是为了回报。 Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes) 1.

M: Hi, Anna! Welcome back! How’s your trip to the States? 
W: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings, so, of course, I didn’t have much time to see . 
M: What a pity! Actually, I have a trip there myself next week. 
W: Do you? Then take my advice, do the well-being in the air program. It really works. 
M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works? 
W: Yes, I did the program on the flight to the States, and when I arrived at , I didn’t have any problem, no jet lag at all. On the way back, I didn’t do it, and I felt terrible. 
M: You’re joking! 
W: Not at all, it really meant a lot of difference. 
M: En. So what did you do? 
W: Well, I didn’t drink an alcohol or coffee, and I didn’t eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water, and fresh juice, and I ate the noodles on the well-being menu. They’re lighter. They have fish, vegetables, and noodles, for example, and I did some of the exercises of the program. 
M: Exercises? On a plane? 
W: Yes. I didn’t do many, of course, there isn’t much space on a plane. 
M: How many passengers do the exercises?

M: Yes, Johnson, James Johnson. 
W: My name’s Susan Carter. Are you looking for anything in particular, or are you interested in computers in general?

W: What’s your line of business, Mr. Johnson? 
M: We’re a training consultancy. 
W: I see. And what do you mean “to keep on top”?

The new year always brings with the cultural tradition of new possibilities. We see it as a chance for renewal. We begin to dream of new possible selves. We design our ideal self or an image that is quite different from what we are now. For some of us, we roll at dreamy film in our heads just because it’s the beginning of a new year. But we aren’t serious about making changes. We just make some half-hearted resolution and it evaporates after a week or two. The experience makes us feel less successful and leads us to discount our ability to change in the future. It’ not the change is impossible but that it would lose(?) unless our resolutions are supported with plans for implementation. We have to make our intentions manageable by detailing the specific steps that will carry us to our goal. Say your goal is to lose weight by dieting and cutting off sweets. But one night you just have to have a cookie. And you know there’s a bag of your favorites in the cupboard. You want one, you eat two, you check the bag and find out you’ve just shot 132 calories. You say to yourself, “What the hell!” and polish off the whole bag. Then you begin to draw all kinds of unpleasant conclusions about yourself. To protect your sense of self, you begin to discount the goal. You may think – “Well, dieting wasn’t that important to me and I won’t make it anyhow.” So you abandon the goal and return to your bad habits.  26 What do people usually wish to do at the beginning of a new year? 
27 How can people turn their new year’s resolutions into reality? 
28 Why does the speaker mention the example of sweets and cookies?  P2 
25 years ago, Ray Anderson, a single parent with a one-year-old son witnessed a terrible accident which took place when the driver of a truck ran a red light and collided with the car of Sandra D. The impact of the collision killed Sandra instantly. But her three-month-old daughter was left trapped in the burning car. While others looked on in horror, Andersen jumped out of his vehicle and crawled into the car through the shadowed rear window to try to free the infant. Seconds later, the car was enclosed in flames. But to everyone’s amazement, Andersen was able to pull the baby to safety. While the baby was all right, Andersen was seriously injured. Two days later he died. But his heroic act was published widely in the media. His son was soon adopted by relatives. The most remarkable part of the story unfolded only last week. Karen and her boyfriend Michael were looking through some old boxes when they came across some old newspaper clippings. “This is me when I was a new born baby. I was rescued from a burning car. But my mother died in the accident,” explained Karen. Although Michael knew Karen’s mother had died years earlier, he never fully understood the circumstances until he skimmed over the newspaper article. To Karen’s surprise, Michael was absorbed in the details of the accident. And he began to cry uncontrollably. Then he revealed that the man that pulled Karen from the flames was the father he never knew. The two embraced and shed many tears, recounting stories told to them about their parents.  29 What happened twenty-five years ago? 
30 What does the speaker say about Michael’s father? 
31 Why did Michael cry uncontrollably when he skimmed over the newspaper article?  P3 
Americans suffer from an overdose of work. Regardless of who they are or what they do. Americans spend more time at work than that any time since World War II. In 1950, the  had fewer working hours than any other industrialized country. Today, it exceeds every country but  where industrialized employees load 2155 hours a year compared with  the  and  the former . Between 1969 and 1989, employed Americans add an average of 138 hours to their yearly work schedules. The workweek has remained above 40 hours. But people are working more weeks each year. Specifically pay time off holidays, vacations, sick leave shrink by 50% in the 1980s. As corporations have experienced stiff competitions and slow in growth of productivity, they have pressed employees to work longer. Cost-cutting lay-offs in the 1980s reduce the professional and managerial runs, leaving fewer people to get the job done. In lower paid occupations where wages have been reduced, workers have added hours in overtime or extra jobs to preserve their living standards. The government estimates that more than 7 million people hold a second job. For the first time, large numbers of people say they want to cut back on working hours even it means earning less money. But most employers are unwilling to let them do so. The government which has stepped back from its traditional role as a regulator of work time should take steps to make shorter hours possible. 
Question 32-35 are based on the passage you’ve just heard 
32. In which country do industrial employees work the longest hours? 
33. How do employed Americans manage to work more hours? 
34. Why do corporations press their employees to work longer hours according to the speaker? 
35. What does the speaker say many Americans prefer to do?  Compound dictation  Nursing, as a typically female profession, must deal constantly with the false impression that nurses are there to wait on the physician. As nurses, we are licensed to provide nursing care only. We do not have any legal or moral obligation to any physician. We provide health teaching, assess physical as well as emotional problems, coordinate patient related services, and make all our nursing decision based upon what is best or suitable for the patient. If in any circumstance we feel that a physician’s order is inappropriate or unsafe, we have a legal responsibility to question that order, or refuse to carry it out. Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off. All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession. The emotional and physical stress, however, that occurs due to odd working hours is a prime reason for a large of the career dissatisfaction. It is sometimes required that we work overtime, and that we change shifts four or five times a month. That disturbs our personal lives, destruct our sleeping and eating habits, and isolates us from everything except job related friends and activities. The quality of nursing care is being affected dramatically by these situations. Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates, as experienced nurses finally give up trying to change the system. Consumers of medically related services have evidently not been affected enough yet to demand changes in our medical system. But if trends continue as predicted, they will find that most critical hospital care will be provided by new, inexperienced, and sometimes inadequately trained nurses.
