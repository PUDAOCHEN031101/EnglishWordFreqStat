Seven Ways to Save the World Forget the old idea that conserving energy is a form of self-denial — riding bicycles, dimming the lights, and taking fewer showers. These days conservation is all about efficiency: getting the same — or better — results from just a fraction of the energy. When a slump in business travel forced Ulrich Rǒmer to cut cost costs at his family-owned hotel in , he replaced hundreds of the hotel’s wasteful light bulbs, getting the same light for 80 percent less power. He bought a new water boiler with a digitally controlled pump, and wrapped insulation around the pipes. Spending about € 100,000 on these and other improvements, he slashed his € 90,000 fuel and power bill by € 60,000. As a bonus, the hotel’s lower energy needs have reduced its annual carbon emissions by more than 200 metric tons. “For us, saving energy has been very, very profitable,” he says. “And most importantly, we’re not giving up a single comfort for our guests.”      Efficiency is also a great way to lower carbon emissions and help slow global warming. But the best argument for efficiency is its cost — or, more precisely, its profitability. That’s because quickly growing energy demand requires immense investment in new supply, not to mention the drain of rising energy prices.      No wonder efficiency has moved to the top of the political agenda. On Jan. 10, the European Union unveiled a plan to cut energy use across the continent by 20 percent by 2020. Last March,  imposed a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Even George W. Bush, the  oilman, is expected to talk about energy conversation in his State of the Union speech this week.      The good news is that the world is full of proven, cheap ways to save energy. Here are the seven that could have the biggest impact: Insulate  Space heating and cooling eats up 36 percent of all the world’s energy. There’s virtually no limit to how much of that can be saved, as prototype “zero-energy homes” in  and  have shown. There’s been a surge in new ways of keeping heat in and cold out (or vice versa). The most advanced insulation follows the law of increasing returns: if you add enough, you can scale down or even eliminate heating and air-conditioning equipment, lowering costs even before you start saving on utility bills. Studies have shown that green workplaces (ones that don’t constantly need to have the heat or air-conditioner running) have higher worker productivity and lower sick rates. Change Bulbs Lighting eats up 20 percent of the world’s electricity, or the equivalent of roughly 600,000 tons of coal a day. Forty percent of that powers old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs — a 19th-century technology that wastes most of the power it consumes on unwanted heat. Compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, not only use 75 to 80 percent less electricity than incandescent bulbs to generate the same amount of light, but they also last 10 times longer. Phasing old bulbs out by 2030 would save the output of 650 power plants and avoid the release of 700 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. Comfort Zone  Water boilers, space heaters and air conditioners have been notoriously inefficient. The heat pump has altered that equation. It removes heat from the air outside or the ground below and uses it to supply heat to a building or its water supply. In the summer, the system can be reversed to cool building as well. Most new residential buildings in  are already heated with ground-source heat pumps. Such systems consume almost no conventional fuel at all. Several countries have used subsidies to jump-start the market, including , where almost 1 million heat pumps have been installed in the past two years to heat water for showers and hot tubs.
Remake Factories       From steel mills to paper factories, industry eats up about a third of the world’s energy. The opportunities to save are vast. In , German chemicals giant BASF runs an interconnected complex of more than 200 chemical factories, where heat produced by one chemical process is used to power the next. At the  site alone, such recycling of heat and energy saves the company € 200 million a year and almost half its CO2 emissions. Now BASF is doing the same for new plants in . “Optimizing (优化) energy efficiency is a decisive competitive advantage, ” says BASF CEO Jǔrgen Hambrecht.
Green Driving  A quarter of the world’s energy — including two thirds of the annual production of oil — is used for transportation. Some savings come free of charge: you can boost fuel efficiency by 6 percent simply by keeping your car’s tires properly inflated (充气). Gasoline-electric hybrid (混合型) models like the Toyota Prius improve mileage by a further 20 percent over conventional models. A Better Fridge More than half of all residential power goes into running household appliances，producing a fifth of the world’s carbon emissions. And that’s true even though manufacturers have already hiked the efficiency of refrigerators and other white goods by as much as 70 percent since the 1980s. According to an International Energy Agency study, if consumers chose those models that would save them the most money over the life of the appliance, they’d cut global residential power consumption and their utility bills by 43 percent. Flexible Payment       Who says you have to pay for all your conservation investment？“Energy service contractors” will pay for retrofitting (翻折改造) in return for a share of the client’s annual utility-bill savings. In , Shenwu Thermal Energy Technology Co. specializes in retrofitting ’s steel furnaces. Shenwu puts up the initial investment to install a heat exchanger that preheats the air going into the furnace，slashing the client’s fuel costs . Shenwu pockets a cut of those savings, so both Shenwu and the client profit. 　　 If saving energy is so easy and profitable, why isn’t everyone doing it? It has to do with psychology and a lack of information. Most of us tend to look at today’s price tag more than tomorrow’s potential savings. That holds double for the landlord or developer, who won’t actually see a penny of the savings his investment in better insulation or a better heating system might generate. In many people’s minds, conservation is still associated with self-denial. Many environmentalists still push that view. Smart governments can help push the market in the right direction. The EU’s 1994 law on labeling was such a success that it extended the same idea to entire buildings last year. To boost the market value of efficiency, all new buildings are required to have an “energy pass” detailing power and heating consumption. Countries like  and  have successively tightened building codes, requiring an increase in insulation levels but leaving it up to builders to decide how to meet them. The most powerful incentives, of course, will come from the market itself. Over the past year, sky-high fuel prices have focused minds on efficiency like never before. Ever-increasing pressure to cut costs has finally forced more companies to do some math on their energy use. Will it be enough? With global demand and emissions rising so fast, we may not have any choice but to try. Efficient technology is here now, proven and cheap. Compared with all other options, it’s the biggest, easiest and most profitable bang for the buck. 注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。 1. What is said to be the best way to conserve energy nowadays?

Part IV Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes） Section A  Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer sheet 2. Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage. Men, these days, are embracing fatherhood with the round-the-clock involvement their partners have always dreamed of — handling night feedings, packing lunches and bandaging knees. But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information. “Men in my generation (aged 25-40) have a fear of becoming dads because we have no role models,” says Jon Smith, a writer. They often find themselves excluded from mothers’ support networks, and are eyed warily (警觉地) on the playground. The challenge is particularly evident in the work-place. There, men are still expected to be  breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder: traditionally-minded bosses are often unsympathetic to family needs. In Denmark most new fathers only take two weeks of paternity leave (父亲的陪产假) — even though they are allowed 34 days. As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements. Though Wilfried-Fritz Maring, 54, a data-bank and Internet specialist with German firm FIZ  , feels that the time he spends with his daughter outweighs any disadvantages, he admits, “With my decision to work from home I dismissed any opportunity for promotion.” Mind-sets (思维定势) are changing gradually. When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to choose a job that could be performed from there. Danish telecom company TDC initiated an internal campaign last year to encourage dads to  take paternity leave: 97 percent now do. “When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training: in how to keep cool under stress.” says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. For a new generation of dads, kids may come before the company － but it’s a shift that benefits both. 47. Unlike women, men often get little support or information from          . 48. Besides supporting the family, men were also expected to          . 49. Like women, men hope that their desire for a flexible schedule will be          . 50. When Maring was on paternity leave, he was allowed by his company to work         .  51. Christine Holm believes paternity leave provides a new kind of training for men in that it can help them cope with          . Section B  Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage. Like most people, I’ve long understood that I will be judged by my occupation, that my profession is a gauge people use to see how smart or talented I am. Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person. Last year I left a professional position as a small-town reporter and took a job waiting tables. As someone paid to serve food to people. I had customers say and do things to me I suspect they’d never say or do to their most casual acquaintances. One night a man talking on his cell phone waved me away, then beckoned (示意) me back with his finger minute later, complaining he was ready to order and asking where I’d been. I had waited tables during summers in college and was treated like a peon (勤杂工) plenty of people. But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. Besides, people responded to me differently after I told them I was in college. Customers would joke that one day I’d be sitting at their table, waiting to be served. Once I graduated I took a job at a community newspaper. From my first day, I heard a respectful tone from everyone who called me. I assumed this was the way the professional world worked — cordially. I soon found out differently. I sat several feet away from an advertising sales representative with a similar name. Our calls would often get mixed up and someone asking for Kristen would be transferred to Christie. The mistake was immediately evident. Perhaps it was because money was involved, but people used a tone with Kristen that they never used with me. My job title made people treat me with courtesy. So it was a shock to return to the restaurant industry. It’s no secret that there’s a lot to put up with when waiting tables, and fortunately, much of it can be easily forgotten when you pocket the tips. The service industry, by definition, exists to cater to others’ needs. Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant. I’m now applying to graduated school, which means someday I’ll return to a profession where people need to be nice to me in order to get what they want, I think I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them. 52. The author was disappointed to find that _______. [A] one’s position is used as a gauge to measure one’s intelligence [B] talented people like her should fail to get a respectable job [C] one’s occupation affects the way one is treated as a person [D] professionals tend to look down upon manual workers 53. What does the author intend to say by the example in the second paragraph? [A] Some customers simply show no respect to those who serve them. [B] People absorbed in a phone conversation tend to be absent-minded. [C] Waitresses are often treated by customers as casual acquaintances. [D] Some customers like to make loud complaints for no reason at all. 54. How did the author feel when waiting tables at the age of 19? [A] She felt it unfair to be treated as a mere servant by professional. [B] She felt badly hurt when her customers regarded her as a peon. [C] She was embarrassed each time her customers joked with her. [D] She found it natural for professionals to treat her as inferior. 55. What does the author imply by saying “…many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant”(Lines 3-4, Para.7)? [A] Those who cater to others’ needs are destined to be looked down upon. [B] Those working in the service industry shouldn’t be treated as servants. [C] Those serving others have to put up with rough treatment to earn a living. [D] The majority of customers tend to look on a servant as server nowadays. 56. The author says she’ll one day take her clients to dinner in order to ________. [A] see what kind of person they are [B] experience the feeling of being served [C] show her generosity towards people inferior to her [D] arouse their sympathy for people living a humble life Passage Two Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. What’s hot for 2007 among the very rich? A $7.3million diamond ring. A trip to  to hunt wild animals. Oh, and income inequality. Sure, some leftish billionaires like George Soros have been railing against income inequality for years. But increasingly, centrist and right-wing billionaires are staring to worry about income inequality and the fate of the middle class. In December, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote a column in U.S. News & World Report, which he owns. “our nation’s core bargain with the middle class is disintegrating,” lamented (哀叹) the 117th-richest man in America. “Most of our economic gains have gone to people at the very top of the income ladder. Average income for a household of people of working age, by contrast, has fallen five years in a raw.” He noted that “Tens of millions of Americans live in fear that a major health problem can reduce them to bankruptcy.” Wilbur Ross Jr. has echoed Zuckerman’s anger over the bitter struggles faced by middle-class Americans. “It’s an outrage that any American’s life expectancy should be shortened simply because the company they worked for went bankrupt and ended health-care coverage,” said the former chairman of the International Steel Group. What’s happening? The very rich are just as trendy as you and I, and can be so when it comes to politics and policy. Given the recent change of control in Congress, the popularity of measures like increasing the minimum wage, and efforts by California’s governor to offer universal health care, these guys don’t need their own personal weathermen to know which way the wind blows. It’s possible that plutocrats (有钱有势的人) are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory (没收性的) tax policies. But the prospect that income inequality will lead to higher taxes on the wealthy doesn’t keep plutocrats up at night. They can live with that. No, what they fear was that the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the  because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity. In other words, if middle-class Americans continue to struggle financially as the ultrawealthy grow ever wealthier, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain political support for the free flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. And when the  places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. For people who buy and sell companies, or who allocate capital to markets all around the world, that’s the real nightmare. 57. What is the current topic of common interest among the very rich in ?

Believe it or not, look around yourself and you can easily find one or two of these stuffs. 　　Here is a question，what kind of influence do the digital products bring to people’s life.? Frankly speaking, these modern digital products offer us a more convenient life than before. For example, the digital camera makes it possible to delete or correct the “unsuccessful” photo of ours, which was impossible with the traditional camera. While, unfortunately, these fashionable digital items have cultivated a generation more isolated from the real life. It is hard to imagine that a man so accustomed to the digital mobile on-line chatting can be capable of the practical communication with others. Finally, too much dependent on the digital things, human seem to be more indifferent to the real world, which we, though reluctant to admit, have to accept. 　　Thus, as the generation assailed by all kinds of digital miracles, we might as well initiatively avoid some of them despite efficiency and comfort they can supply. Don’t forget those old days when you were going to visit an old school friend though there would be a long train journey, which, in today’s digital era, has been thoroughly replaced by the digital on-line chatting.

efficiency: getting the same—or better—results from just a fraction of the energy. 
[精解]题干中的the best way与原文中的all about是同义转述。原文中提到“现在节约都与效率相关”，随后进行了详细解说。换言之，节约能源的最好方式就是能源使用效率的提高。

[精解]题干中的句子和原文的句子都有条件状语从句，结构相似，对比之后，可以得出答案为those models that would save them the most money，结合原文前一句的内容，这里models实际上是指前一句中的the most efficient models of refrigerators and other white goods，故本题答案为D)。
8. Energy service contractors profit by taking a part of clients’       .
答案：  annual utility-bill savings 
[定位]由题干中的Energy service contractor定位到文章第七个小标题下第2句：“Energy service contractors”will pay for retrofitting in return for a share of the client’s annual utility-bill savings. 
[精解]此处需要填入名词性成分承接前面的所有格形式。题干中的profit是动词，意为“获利”，与原文中的in return属近义表达，题干中的a part of和原文中的a share of是同义转述，由此可知Energy service contractors获得利润的方式就是收取部分annual utility-bill savings，即本题答案。

[精解]此处需要填入名词性成分作介词with的宾语。题干中的maintain the view和原文中的push that view是同义转述，但是view的内容没有在最后一句中提到，而是出现在前一句中：许多人认为节约仍然与自我节制相关。题干中的has much to do with和原文中的is still associated with是同义转述，介词with后的宾语self-denial就是本题的答案。
10. The strongest incentives for energy conservation will derive from        .
答案：  the market itself
[定位]由题干中的incentives for energy conservation定位到文章倒数第二段首句：The most powerful incentives, of course, will come from the market itself. 
[精解]此处需要填入名词性成分作介词from的宾语。题干中的strongest和derive from分别是对原文中的most powerful和come from的同义转述，两个句子中的from的宾语是相同的，故答案为the market itself。

Section B    
Passage One    
Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
     In January 1989, (26) the Community of European Railways presented their proposal for a high speed pan-European train network extending from Sweden to Sicily, and from Portugal to Poland by the year 2020. (27) If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in . Journeys between major cities will take half the time they take today.  will be only one and a half hours from . The quickest way to get from  to Frankfurt, from  to  will be by train, not plane. When the network is complete, it will integrate three types of railway line:totally new high speed lines with trains operating at speeds of 300 kilometers per hour, upgraded lines which allow for speeds up to 200 to 225 kilometers per hour, and existing lines for local connections and distribution of freight. If business people can choose between a three-hour train journey from city-center to city-center and a one-hour flight, they’ll choose the train, says an executive travel consultant. They won’t go by plane any more. (28) If you calculate flight time, check-in and travel to and from the airport, you’ll find almost no difference. And if your plane arrives late due to bad weather or air traffic jams or strikes, then the train passengers will arrive at their destination first. (29) Since  introduced the first 260-kilometer-per-hour high speed train service between Paris and Lyons in 1981, the trains have achieved higher and higher speeds. On many routes, airlines have lost up to 90% of their passengers to high speed trains. If people accept the Community of European Railways’ plan, the 21 century will be the new age of the train. 
预览四道题的选项，由选项中的词汇passengers, railroad, railway lines, express train, plane, airlines等表达可以推
知，短文很可能与交通运输或旅行相关。
26. What is the proposal presented by the Community of European Railways?
［答案］D) To set up an express train network throughout Europe.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是表示目的的不定式短语，因此猜测本题考查做某事的目的。
[精解]短文开头提到1989年欧洲铁道协会提出建议在2020年前修建从瑞典到西西里，从葡萄牙到波兰的横贯欧洲的高速铁路网。由此可知欧洲铁道协会提出的建议是修建横贯欧洲的高速铁路网，故选项D)正确。
27. What will happen when the proposal becomes a reality?
［答案］C) Traveling time by train between major European cities will be cut by half.
[听前猜测]四个选项关于旅行费用和旅行时间的变化、旅行方式的优劣，这些都与某一事件的后果有关，因此推测本题考查某一事件带来的影响。
[精解]短文中明确提到If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in Europe. Journeys 
between major cities will take half the time they take today，即“如果这一方案成为现实，欧洲铁路运输业将会发生革命性变化。主要城市间的旅行时间可以比现在缩短一半”，所以本题的答案为C)。
28. Why will business people prefer a three-hour train journey to a one-hour flight?
［答案］D) Traveling by train may be as quick as,or even quicker than, by air.
[听前猜测]四个选项都出现了than引导的比较级，而且比较的对象都是train travel和air travel，所以可以推测本题考查对train travel和air travel的比较。
[精解]文中提到，飞机旅行固然比火车旅行更快，但是如果把飞行时间和往返机场的时间加起来，两者几乎没有
什么区别了。而且，如果遇到恶劣天气或航班拥挤或罢工，乘坐火车的乘客将会最先到达目的地。综合而言，火车旅行可以和飞机旅行一样快，甚至比飞机旅行还要快。故选项D)正确。
29. When did  introduce the first high speed train service?

Passage Two
Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
    (30) Western doctors are beginning to understand what traditional healers have always known that the body and the mind are inseparable. Until recently, modern urban physicians heal the body, psychiatrist the mind, and priests the soul. However, the medical world is now paying more attention to holistic medicine, which is an approach based on the belief that people’s state of mind can make them sick or speed their recovery from sickness. (31) Several study show that the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it. For example, in one recent study, psychiatrist and a major hospital tried to see how patients could be made calm. They divided them into two groups. One group was given a drug while the other group received a harmless substance instead of medicine without their knowledge. Surprisingly, more patients in the second group showed the desired effect than those in the first group. In study after study, there’s a positive reaction in almost one-third of the patients taking harmless substances. How was this possible? How can such a substance have an effect on the body? (32) Evidence from a 1997 study at the  shows that several patients who received such substances were able to produce their own natural drug, that is, as they took the substance their brains released natural chemicals that act like a drug. Scientists theorized that the amount of these chemicals released by a person’s brain quite possibly indicates how much faith the person has in his or her doctor. 
预览三道题各选项，出现了很多与医生和病人相关的词汇，如mental patients，healing，medical profession，doctor，hospital，recovery，drug，remedies等，由此可以推测这篇短文的谈论话题为医疗医药。
30. According to the speaker, what are western doctors beginning to understand?
［答案］C) The mind and body should be taken as an integral whole.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是陈述句，都是人们对事情的看法，因此推断本题考查人们对事情的看法。

31. What does the recent study at a major hospital seem to prove?
［答案］D) A patient’s expectations of a drug have an effect on their recovery.
[听前猜测]四个选项中除了B)都提到了影响病人康复的因素，有doctor’s fame，harmless substances和patient’s expectations of a drug等，由此推测本题考查影响病人康复快慢的各种因素。
[精解]文章中间部分提到多项研究表明，the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it，即“药效往往取决于病人对药物的期待程度”，选项D)是对此意的转述，故为正确答案。
32. What evidence does the 1997 study at the  produce?
［答案］B) The workings of the mind may help patients recover.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是与病人的治疗效果有关，听音时注意相关介绍。
[精解]文章在最后部分介绍了加州大学1997年的研究。研究表明，许多服用无毒物质的病人能够在体内释放出象药物一样的化学物质。换句话说，病人的意识对康复有很大的影响。
Passage Three
Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. 
     (35) So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves: Why is this person doing this? Why do people take these risks and put themselves in danger when they don’t have to? (33) One common trait among risk-takers is that they enjoy strong feelings or sensations. We call this trait sensation-seeking. A sensation-seeker is someone who’s always looking for new sensations. What else do we know about sensation-seekers? Well, as I said, sensation-seekers like strong emotions. You can see this trait in many parts of a person’s life, not just in extreme sports. For example, many sensation-seekers enjoy hard rock music. They like the loud sound and strong emotion of the songs. Similarly, sensation-seekers enjoy frightening horror movies. They like the feeling of being scared and horrified while watching the movie. This feeling is even stronger for extreme sports where the person faces real danger. Sensation-seekers feel the danger is very exciting. In addition, sensation-seekers like new experiences that force them to push their personal limits. (34) For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring. Many sensation-seekers choose jobs that involve risk, such as starting a new business or being an emergency room doctor. These jobs are different everyday, so they never know what will happen. That’s why many sensation-seekers also like extreme sports. When you do rock-climbing, you never know what will happen. The activity is always new and different. 
预览三道题各选项，根据33、34题推断本文可能与一些高难度的刺激活动相关，如攀岩、看恐怖电影等。
33. According to the speaker, what is a common trait among risk-takers?
［答案］A) Enjoying strong feelings and emotions.

[精解]文章中提到，喜欢冒险的人的一个最常见的特性是they enjoy strong feelings or sensations，即他们喜欢强烈的感觉和感情。sensation意为“感觉，感情”，与emotion同义，故选项A)正确。
34. What do sensation-seekers find boring?
［答案］D) Doing daily routines.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是动名词短语，都是一些人类活动，由此推测本题可能考查人的动作。
[精解]文章在后半部分提到For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring，即对他们(喜欢冒险的人)来说，每天重复同样的事情是很无聊的，选项D)中的daily routine和repeating the same things everyday属于同义转述，故选项D)正确。
35. What is the speaker’s profession?
［答案］B) A psychologist.

[精解]文章主要谈论喜欢冒险的人喜欢做的事情及其原因，再加上文章一开始就提到 So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves. . . 从说话的口气和自称psychologist可知，说话人的职业是psychologist，故选项B)正确。

 Part Ⅳ   Reading Comprehension（Reading in Depth）(25 minutes)
Section A
    议论文。本文讨论了男性劳动者在身为人父后所面临的来自家庭和职场的双重压力。随着思维定势的转变，人们采取了一些灵活的方法来解决该问题，照顾子女和拼搏职场不再是完全对立的，而是变得相得益彰。
47. mother’s support networks
[定位]根据题干中的unlike women和support or information定位到原文第一段第2句But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information和第4句They often find themselves excluded from mother’s support networks. . . 
[精解]本题问的是男女双方在获得支持和信息方面的不同。题干中的get little. . . 和第4句中的excluded是同义转述，两个句子都含有from引导的介词短语，from的宾语mother’s support networks就是本题的答案。
48. climb the corporate ladder
[定位]根据题干中的men were also expected to定位到原文第二段第2句There, men are still expected to be breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder. 
[精解]本题针对男士应该承担的责任提问，题干中已经给出了其责任之一：supporting family，这和第2句中的be breadwinners“负担家计的人”属同义转述。分析第2句的句子结构，现在分词climbing引导的短语作伴随状语，其内容就是男人应该承担的另一个责任，即climbing the corporate ladder。但是结合题干对原文作出的改变，be expected to后要接动词原形，故本题答案为climb the corporate ladder。
49. taken seriously
[定位]根据题干中的flexible schedule定位到原文第2段末句As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements. 
[精解]题干中的like是对原句中As much as if not more so than的概括与同义转述，desire和request，hope和struggle也为同义转述，同时两个句子结构相同，都使用了被动语态，所以答案就很清楚了，为taken seriously。
50. at home/in a home office
[定位]根据题干中的Maring, paternity leave和his company定位到原文第4段第2句When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to chose a job that could be performed from there. 
[精解]本题针对Maring休陪产假时的工作地点提问。题干中Maring was on paternity leave(休陪产假)和原句中的Maring had a daughter(有了女儿)是同义转述，原句中提到公司为他配备了一间家庭办公室，显然是允许他在家中工作，所以本题的答案为at home或in a home office。
51. stress
[定位]根据题干中的人名Christine Holm, paternity leave和a new kind of training定位到原文末段第4句“When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training:in how to keep cool under stress, ”says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. 
[精解]题目问为什么陪产假能够让男性员工得到锻炼。根据原句可知，陪产假可以让员工接受一种新的训练：如何在压力下保持冷静。结合题干，可见，陪产假可以帮助员工应对stress(压力)，这就是本题的答案。
 Section B
Passage One
52. C)。 [定位]由题干中的the author was disappointed定位到原文首段第2句Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person. 
[精解]语义题。首先要确定从句中的主语it指代前一句中的my occupation(职业)，由此可以看出，让作者感到失望的是“我的工作也能决定我身而为人是如何被对待的”，选项C)“人的工作可以影响到他作为一个人被对待的方式”与原文是同义转述，因此C)为答案。
53. A)。 [定位]由题干中提到的the example in the second paragraph定位到第2段。
[精解]推断题。第2段所举事例是说，作者在当饭店招待员时碰到了一位蛮横无礼的顾客，对她随意地呼来唤去。由此可见，作者想表达的意思是：很多顾客不尊重为他们提供服务的人，所以A)正确。
54. D)。 [定位]由题干中的waiting tables at the age of 19定位到原文第3段第2句But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. 
[精解]语义题。作者19岁时在饭店当招待员，不被顾客尊重，她对此的看法是“deserved inferior treatment”，即“比别人低人一等是理所应当的”，换句话说，作者认为这是十分自然的，即选项D)所述的“natural”。正确答案为D)。
55. B)。 [定位]由题干定位到原文第7段末句Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant. 
[精解]推断题。本题问的是作者说这句话所要表达的深意。句子的意思是“很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别”，换句话说，许多顾客把给他们提供服务的服务生当成仆人了，在现代社会中，这显然是不正确的，即选项B)所述“服务行业的人员不应该被当成仆人来对待。”
56. A)。 [定位]由题干中的She’ll one day take her clients to dinner定位到原文末段最后一句I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them. 
[精解]推断题。原文中提到，对于有求于她的人，作者会先带他去吃饭，看看他是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。结合前文作者的经历和感受，可以看出，作者是想通过观察他对服务生的态度和举止来了解这个人的品性，故选项A)为答案。
 参考译文：
       同大部分人一样，我早就明白人们会通过我从事的工作来判断我。我的职业就如同一个标尺，人们通过它来衡量我有多么聪明或睿智。(52)但是，最近令我深感失望的是，我看到工作同样也决定了身而为人的我将会如何被对待。
      去年，我辞职不再做小镇的记者，转而找了一份招待员的工作。做着领薪水为他人提供餐饮服务的工作，我遇到一些顾客，他们对我说了一些也做了一些我觉得他们从来没有对一般的熟人说过或做过的事情。(53)一天晚上一个拿着手机打电话的男子挥手示意我离开，然后不到一分钟又用手指示意我回来，埋怨说他已经准备好点菜，问我去哪里了。
    暑假里我在大学里当招待员，被很多人当作勤杂工一样对待。(54)但是年仅19岁的年龄，我认为接受一些来自成年职业人士的劣等对待并无不当。况且，在我告诉他们我在上大学时，他们对我的反应就会有所不同。客人们会对我开玩笑说，有朝一日我也可以坐在桌子边上，等候着有人提供服务。
    毕业之后，我在一家社区报纸找到了一份工作。从第一天起，我从任何一位称呼我的人口中听到的都是尊敬的口吻。我以为这就是职场的运作方式——诚恳。
    很快我有了不同的发现。我坐的位置距离一位和我的名字非常相似的广告销售代表仅有几英尺远。我们的电话经常混淆，Kristen的电话会被转接给Christie。错误很快就清楚了。也许是因为钱的缘故，对着Kristen讲话时，人们总是使用一种从来没有对我使用过的口吻。
     我的工作头衔让人们非常谦恭地对待我。所以，重新回到饭店行业让人感到震惊。
     站在桌边等顾客点菜时有很多需要容忍的事情，这已经不是什么秘密了。但是，幸运的是，当你拿到小费时，就会忘记很多的不满。服务业，顾名思义，它之所以存在就是要满足别人的需要。(55)而且，看起来我的很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别。    现在我正在申请读研究生，这就意味着将来有一天我会重新找到一份工作，一份人们为了得到他们想得到的东西而对我非常友好的工作。(56)我想我会先带他们去吃饭，借机看一下他们是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。

Passage Two
57. C)。 [定位]由题干中的current topic of common interest among the very rich定位到原文首段。
[精解]细节题。题干中的current topic of common interest是对原文中hot一词的具体解释。对于富人们2007年最感兴趣的事情，原文中提到了三个：A $7. 3 million diamond ring，A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals和income inequality，其中第3个是最重要的，结合选项可以看出本题的答案是C)。
58. C)。 [定位]由题干中的Mortimer Zucherman’s lamentation定位到原文第三段中的一系列进行哀叹的话语。 [精解]语义题。第三段第3句提到“我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”选项C)“虽然财富在不断增加，但是美国人的贫富分化状况不断加大”对此进行了概括，是本题的答案。
59. B)。 [定位]由题干中的the fifth paragraph定位到原文第5段的内容。
[精解]推断题。第5段第2句提到“巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此”，由此可见，巨富者不但关心时尚变化，而且十分关注政治和政策，即选项B)所说的“巨富者在政治上十分敏感”。
60. C)。 [定位]由题干中的plutocrats和express solidarity with the middle class定位到原文第6段首句It’s possible that plutocrats are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory tax policies. 
[精解]推断题。本题提问有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结的real reason(真正原因)。从表面上看，有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结，目的是防止出现没收性的税收政策，会觉得A)正确；但是继续往下读文章，第7段继续陈述了有钱有势的人害怕中产阶级的深层原因，也是真正原因：the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the . . . ，简而言之，他们希望在全球经济融合问
题上获得中产阶级的支持，这才是他们的最大利益所在，即C)所述内容。因此选项C)是本题的答案。61. D)。 [定位]由题干中的条件从句if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods定位到原文末段第2句And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. 
[精解]语义题。题干的条件从句和原文中的很相似，而且题干中的what may happen是对原文中的it’s likely to. . . 的同义转述，后面的内容encourage reciprocal action abroad就是答案所在。reciprocal意为“相应的，交互的”，所以本题的答案为D)“作为回应，外国也会设置同样的经济壁垒”。
 参考译文：
     (57)2007年巨富们对什么事情最关心？价值730万美元的钻戒。去坦桑尼亚旅行、打猎。哦，还有收入的不平等。
    的确，一些象George Soros一样的左派富翁多年来一直抨击收入不公平问题。但是，中间派议员们和右派富翁也越来越担心收入不公平问题和中产阶级的命运。
    12月份，Mortimer Zuckerman在自己拥有的《美国新闻与世界报导》上发表专栏文章。“我们国家与中产阶级之间的核心契约正在瓦解，”美国排名第117位的富翁哀叹道。“(58)我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”他说，“成百上千万美国人生活在恐惧中，他们害怕严重的健康问题会让他们破产。”
    Zuckerman对于中产阶级所面临的苦苦挣扎表示极大愤慨，Wilbur Ross Jr. 随即作出响应。“如果任何美国人寿命的缩短仅仅是因为他所工作的公司破产而没法享受健康救助，这简直就是暴行，”国际钢铁组织前任主席说。
   到底在发生着什么？(59)巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此。就拿最近国会控制权发生的变化，增加最低工资举措的受欢迎以及加利福尼亚州州长努力推行普及健康救助的行动来说，这些人不需要个人天气预报员来了解风往哪个方向吹。 (60)有钱有势的人与苦苦挣扎的中产阶级表示团结以使他们远离没收性的税收政策。这一点是有可能的。但是收入不公平会导致对富者更多的税率的可能性并没有让有钱有势的人半夜里睡不着觉。他们能够承受得了。 不，(60)他们担心的是，因为收入分配和经济安全的现状，若要使全球经济融合得到越来越多的人的支持的政治挑战在美国会变得更困难。
    换句话说，如果美国的中产阶级继续在财政问题上挣扎，而巨富者越来越富有的话，物品、服务和资本跨越国境自由流通将越来越难获得政治上的支持。(61)当美国对外国投资者和外国商品设置障碍时，很有可能国外也会采取相对应的措施。这样，对于那些买卖公司或者向全球市场分配资本的人来说，这无疑是一个真正的梦魇。 Part V Cloze  (15 minutes)   记叙文。本文叙述了物理学家爱因斯坦在1915年间进行科学研究时遇到的问题及其为此所做的努力，同时本文还提到了爱因斯坦同其对手希尔伯特之间的竞争。
