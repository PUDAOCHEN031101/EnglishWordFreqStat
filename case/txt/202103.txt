At 43, I've reached the stage where women are warned to watch out for the creeping sadness of 
middle age. We're served up an endless stream of advice on "how to survive your 40s", as if we're in the 
endurance stage of a slow limp toward 
26 . This is the age women start to become "invisible"-our 
value, attractiveness and power supposedly 
27 
by the vanishing of youth. But I don't feel like I'm 
fading into 
28 
. I feel more seen than I ever have, and for. the first time in my life, I have a clear-eyed 
view of myself that is 
29 
, compassionate and accepting. 
When I look in the mirror, I'm proud of who I am-even those "broken" parts that for so long 
seemed impossible to love. So when advertisers try to sell me ways to "turn back the clock", I have to 
30 
a laugh. I wouldn't go back to the crippling self-consciousness of my youth if you paid me. This 
hard-won sense of self-acceptance is one of the joys of being an older woman. But it's a narrative often 
31 
out by the shame that marketers rely on to peddle us their diet pills, miracle face creams and 
breathable yoga pants-as if self-love is a 
32 
commodity.

 For some women I know, this sense of trust and self-belief later in life gave them the courage to leave 
dysfunctional relationships or 
33 
on new career paths. Others talked about enjoying their own 
company, of growth through 
34 , deepening bonds of friendships, the ability to be more 
compassionate, less judgmental and to listen more and appreciate the small pleasures. Life past 40 is far 
from smooth sailing, but it's so much more than the reductive

statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the 
information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a 
letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 . 
What Are the Ethics of CGI Actors-And Will They Replace Real Ones? 
A) Digital humans are coming to a screen near you. As computer-generated imagery ( CGI) has become
cheaper and more sophisticated, the film industry can now convincingly recreate people on screen­
even actors who have been dead for decades. The technology's ability to effectively keep celebrities
alive beyond the grave is raising questions about public legacies and image rights.
B) Late in 2019, it was announced that US actor James Dean, who died in 1955, will star in a Vietnam
War film scheduled for release later this year. In the film, which will be called Finding Jack , Dean
will be recreated on screen with CGI based on old footage (ďJtflĐ) and photographs, with another
actor voicing him. The news was met with excitement by those keen to see Dean digitally brought back
to life for only his fourth film, but it also drew sharp criticism. "This is puppeteering the dead for their
fame alone," actress Zelda Williams wrote on Twitter. "It sets such an awful precedent for the future
of performance." Het father, Robin Williams, who·died in 2014, was-keen to avoid the same:fate,
Before his death, he filed a deed protecting the use of his image until 2039, preventing others from
recreating him using CGI to appear in a film, TV show or as a hologram (đ.i:lfft).
C) The James Dean film is a way to keep the actor's image relevant for younger generations, says Mark
Roesler of CMG Worldwide, the firm that represents Dean's estate. "I think this is the beginning of
an entire wave," says Travis Cloyd, CEO of Worldwide XR, one of the companies behind the digital
recreation of Dean. "Moving into the future, we want James Dean to be brought into different gaming
environments, or different virtual reality environments, or augmented reality environments," he says.
D) Other actors have been revived, with the permission of their estates, for advertising purposes: for
example, a 2011 advertisement for Dior featured contemporary actress Charlize Theron alongside
iconic 20th-century stars Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Marlene Dietrich. Later, Audrey Hepburn
was digitally recreated for a chocolate commercial in 2013. In the same year, a CGI Bruce Lee
appeared in a Chinese-language ad for a whisky brand, which offended many fans because Lee was
widely known not to drink alcohol at all. "In the last five years, it's become more affordable and more
achievable in a whole movie," says Tim Webber at UK visual effects firm Framestore, the company
behind the Hepburn chocolate ad. Framestore used body doubles with resemblance to Hepburn's facial
structure and body shape as a framework for manual animation. The process was extremely difficult
and expensive, says Webber, but the technology has moved on.

 E) Now, a person can be animated from scratch. "If they're alive today, you can put them in scanning
rigs, you can get every detail of their body analysed very carefully and that makes it much easier,
whereas working from available photographs is tricky," says Webber, who won an Academy Award
for his visual effects work on the 2013 film Gravity. "I also see a lot of actors today who will have the
desire to take advantage of this technology: to have their likeness captured · and stored for future
content," says Cloyd. "They foresee this being something that could give their estates and give their
families the ability to make money from their likeness when they're gone."
F) A hidden hazard of digitally recreating a deceased ( B ě Et9) celebrity is the risk of damaging their
legacy. "We have to respect the security and the integrity of rights holders," says John Canning at
Digital Domain, a US firm that created a hologram rapper (ill,nSt:.AJ·Tupac Shakur, which appeared
at the Coachella music festival in 201Z, 15 years after his death.
G) Legally, a person's rights to control the commercial use of their name and image beyond their death
differ between and even within countries. In certain US states, for example, these rights are treated
similarly to property rights, and are transferable to a person's heirs. In California; under the
Celebrities Rights Act, the personality rights for a celebrity last for 70 years after their death. "We've
got a societal debate going on about access to our public commons, as it were, about famous faces,Ĝ'
says Lilian Edwards at Newcastle University, UK. Should the public be allowed to use or reproduce
images of famous people, given how iconic they are? And what is in. the best interest of a deceased
person's legacy may conflict with the desires of their family or the public, says Edwards.
H) A recreation, however lifelike, will never be indistinguishable from a real actor, says Webber. "When
we are bringing someone back, representing someone who is no longer alive on the screen, what we
are doing is extremely sophisticated digital make"".up," he says; "A performance is a lot more than a
physical resemblance."
I) As it becomes easier to digitally recreate celebrities and to entirely manufacture on'."screen identities,
could this kind of technology put actors out of jobs? "J think actors are worried about this," says
Edwards. "But I think it will take a very long time. 
" This is partly because of the risk that viewers find
virtual humans scary. Edwards cites widespread backlash to the digital recreation of Carrie Fisher as· a
young Princess Leia in Rogue One, a trick later repeated in the recent Star Wars: The Rise of
Skywalker, which was filmed after Fisher's death in 2016. "People didn't like it," she says. "They
discovered the uncanny valley (ifit#ĝ)."
J) This refers to the idea that when objects trying to resemble humans aren't .quite perfect, they can make
viewers feel uneasy because they fall somewhere between obviously non-human and fully human.
"That's always a danger when you're doing anything human or human-like," says Webber. "There're a
thousand things that could go wrong with a computer-generated facial performance, and any one of
those could make it fall into the uncanny valley," he says·; "Your brain j°:st knows there's something
wrong." The problem often arises around the eyes or mouth, says Webber.. "They're the areas that you
look at when you're talking to someone."
K) An unfamiliar digital human that has been created through CGI will also face the same challenge as an
unknown actor: they don't have the appeal of an established name. "You have to spend substantial
capital in creating awareness around their likeness and making sure people are familiar with who they
are," says Cloyd. This is now starting to happen. "The way you pre-sell a movie in a foreign market is
based on relevant talent," he says. "I think we're a long way away from having virtual beings that have
the ability to pre-sell content."
L) Webber expects that we will see more digital humans on screen. "It's happening because it can
happen," he says. Referring to a line from JurassicPark ({$tĞğd0!zm), he adds: "People are too busy
thinking about what they c·an do to think about whether they should do it."

Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished 
statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the 
best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the foil 
owing passage. 
You can't see it, smell it, or hear it, and people disagree on how precisely to define it, or where 
exactly it comes from. It isn't a school subject or an academic discipline, but it can be learned. It is a 
quality that is required of artists, but it is also present in the lives of scientists and entrepreneurs. All of us 
benefit from it and we thrive mentally and spiritually when we are able to wield it. It is a delicate thing, 
easily stamped out; in fact, it flourishes most fully when people are playful and childlike. Meanwhile, it 
works best in conjunction with deep knowledge and expertise. 
This mysterious-but teachable-quality is creativity, the subject of a recently-published report by 
Durham· Commission on Creativity and Education; The report concludes that· creativity-should not inhabit 
the school curriculum only as it relates to drama, music, art and other obviously creative subjects, but that 
creative thinking ought to run through all of school life, infusing (jEr,ffi) the way humanities and natural 
sciences are learned. 
The authors, who focus on education in England, off 
er a number of sensible recommendations, some 
of which are an attempt to alleviate the uninspiring and fact-based approach to education that has crept 
into policy in recent years. When children are regarded as vessels to be filled with facts, creativity does 
not prosper; nor does it when teachers' sole objective is coaching children towards exams. One suggestion 
from the commission is a network of teacher-led "creativity collaboratives", along the lines of existing 
maths hubs. ( rp it:,,) 
, with the aim of supporting teaching for creativity through the school curriculum. 
Nevertheless, it is arts subjects through which creativity can most obviously be fostered. The value 
placed on them by the independent education sector is clear. One only has to look at the remarkable arts 
facilities at Britain's top private schools to comprehend this. But in the state sector the excessive focus on 
English, maths and science threatens to crush arts subjects; meanwhile, reduced school budgets mean 
diminishing extracurricular activities. There has been a 28.1 
% decline in students taking creative subjects 
at high schools since 2014, though happily, art and design have seen a recent increase. 
This discrepancy between state and private education is a matter of social justice. It is simply wrong 
and unfair that most children have a fraction of the access to choirs, orchestras, art studios and drama that

 their more privileged peers enjoy. As lives are affected by any number of looming challenges-climate 
crisis, automation in the workplace-humans are going to need creative thinking more than ever. For all 
of our sakes, creativity in education, and for all, must become a priority. 
46. What do we learn from the passage about creativity?
A) It develops best when people are spiritually prepared.
B) It is most often wielded by scientists and entrepreneurs.
C) It is founded on scientific knowledge and analytical skills.
D) It contributes to intellectual growth but can easily be killed.
47. What is the conclusion of a recently-published report?
A) Natural sciences should be learned the way humanities courses are.
B) Cultivation of creativity should permeate the entire school curriculum.
C) Art courses should be made compulsory for all students.
D) Students should learn more obviously creative subjects.
48. What does the report say is detrimental to the fostering of creativity?
A) Alleviation of pressure.
C) Test-oriented teaching.
B) Teacher-led school activities.
D) Independent learning.
49. What do we learn about the private schools in the UK?
A) They encourage extracurricular activities.
B) They attach great importance to arts education.
C) They prioritize arts subjects over maths and sciences.
D) They cater to students from different family backgrounds.
50. What should be done to meet the future challenges?
A) Increasing government investment in school education.
B) Narrowing the existing gap between the rich and the poor.
C) Providing all children with equal access to arts education.
D) Focusing on meeting the needs of under-privileged students.
Passage Two 
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage. 
Emulating your conversation partner's actions is a common human behavior classified as "mirroring" 
and has been known and studied by psychologists for years. We all tend to subconsciously copy gestures of 
people we like. But why do we act like this? 
As a rule, mirroring means that conversationalists enjoy their communication and that there's a 
certain level of agreement between them. The topic of discussion is equally interesting for both and they 
know their interests meet. 
Repeating someone's behavior is typical of talented communicators, not always because the person is 
sympathetic, but because there is a goal to be achieved. This way new idols have been brought to the 
stage: politicians, celebrities, and other big names. Popular culture makes people want to look popular, 
and act and speak like popular people. 
Nowadays celebrities steal lyrics from each other and struggle with copyright violation accusations or 
straightforwardly claim themselves to be the authors, even though all the work was done by other people 
. 
• 
Among celebrities, it's trendy nowadays to use their own speech writers as politicians do. The so-
called "ghostwriting" can take various forms: books, articles, autobiographies, and even social media 
posts. 
Who is a true copycat (:t&) and who gets copycatted? Sometimes, it is a hard nut to crack without 
an expert's help. But new authorship defending methods based on identifying individual writing patterns 
are already here. Their aim is to protect intellectual property. Using scientific methods, some of them can

 define authorship with 85 
% accuracy. 
Writing is not an easy craft to master. If you want to write like a professional without plagiarism (tf; 
Â) , there are a few lessons to learn and the first one is: "Copy from one, it's plagiarism; copy from two, 
it's research." The correct interpretation of this statement is not about copying, but rather about creating 
your own style. When you study an author's writing style, don't stop on a single one, but explore numerous 
styles instead. Examine types of sentences they use, pay attention to their metaphors, and focus on stories 
you feel you could write a pretty cool sequel (ÌID to. 
Imitation is rather paradoxical. As an integral part of learning, it brings about positive changes, 
making people develop and grow. However, it may do a lot of harm. Copying someone's thoughts, ideas 
or inventions is completely unacceptable. It infringes on intellectual property rights of others. 
Still, many things we do are about copying others one way.or another. So if you want to compliment 
someone on the work they have done and imitate it, just make sure you do it the right way to avoid 
committing plagiarism. 
51. What do people tend to do while engaging in a conversation?
A) Repeat what their partners say one way or another.
B) Focus as much as possible on topics of mutual interest.
C) Imitate their partners' gestures without their knowing it.
D) Observe carefully how their partners make use of gestures.
52. When does mirroring usually take place in a conversation?
A) When both sides are sympathetic with each other.
B) When both sides have a lot of things in common.
C) When both sides make interesting contributions.
D) When both sides try to seek common ground.
53. What do we learn about popular culture?
A) It encourages people to imitate.
C) I.t acquaints young people with their idols.
B) It appeals mostly to big names.
D) It .can change people's mode of cognition.
54. Why is the saying "copy from two, it's research" a lesson to learn?
A) It facilitates the creation of one's own writing style.
B) lt helps tÃ:t prottxt _ont!'S intellectµal pr9perty rights.
C) It fosters correct interpretation of professional writing 
..
D) It enables one to write intriguing sequels to famous stories.
55. Why does the author say imitation is rather paradoxical?
A) It is liable to different interpretations.
C) Jt can give rise to endless disputes.
B) It is by and large a necessary evil.
D) It may do harm as well as good.
